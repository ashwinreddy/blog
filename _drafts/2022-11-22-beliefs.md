title: "What I believe in"
---

I just read my friend Sarv's [post](https://sarvasvkulpati.com/blog/believe) of the same name and felt like I needed one of my own as well.

- Actions are more important than beliefs. I'm guilty as much as anyone else of forgetting this.
- The ancient Greeks got something right with the phrase and discipline _philosophia_. 
- Always doing interpretation
- Technology has its own reasons, frames things towards certain ends. 
- Entropy and information theory.
- Spinoza and pantheism.
