title: "Postscript on Technique in Existing"
---

This essay was inspired by Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly's _All Things Shining_ and Deleuze and Guattari's _What Is Philosophy?_ Dreyfus and Kelly taught and drew on Western classics like _Odyssey_ as well as Heidegger to also come up with a response to meaninglessness and technology. I caution that seeking for meaning per se is a doomed project. See [Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/). 

I hope in future essays to explore the relationship between technology and chaos, on technological practices of the self from Zen Buddhism. In thinking about practical philosophy, I also learned a little bit about pragmatists like George Santayana and William James. For example, affinities between James' pragmatism and Nietzsche's perspectivalism. Also more about literary technics.

A further discussion of Deleuze's error (_Difference and Repetition_) is probably warranted as well. In Descartes's system, thought is intact unless by extrinsic error -- a dogmatic image of thought. But Kant will replace error with illusion. But Kant still thinks of thought as upright. Deleuze considers deception via stupidity and madness and malevolence. For Deleuze, it is always possible for thought to go wrong. Deleuze critiques Hegel, who, although he explains negative in thought through amnesia, fails to show how the dialectic itself can fail. In fact, deception is always in play.
