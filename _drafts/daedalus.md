|-----|-------|
|_Daedalus interea Creten longumque perosus_|Daedalus, meanwhile, loathing Crete and the long|
|_exsilium tactusque loci natalis amore_|Exile, influenced by love of his homeland,|
|_clausus erat pelago. "Terras licet" inquit "et undas"_|Was trapped by the sea. Granted, he said, that earth and sea|
|_obstruat: at caelum certe patet; ibimus illac._|Block me. But the sky certainly is open; We shall go that way.|
|_Omnia possideat, non possidet aera Minos._|Minos might own everything, he can't own the air.|
|_Dixit et ignotas animum dimittit in artes_|He said this and turned his mind to unknown arts|
|_naturamque novat. Nam ponit in ordine pennas_|And he changed nature. For he placed wings in rows|
|_a minima coeptas, longam breviore sequenti,_|Undertaken by the smallest, with the shorter following the longer|
|_ut clivo crevisse putes. Sic rustica quondam_|So that you would think they grew like that, on a slant. Like that, once, a rustic|
|_fistula disparibus paulatim surgit avenis._|Pipe little by little grows, made by unequal reeds.|
|_Tum lino medias et ceris adligat imas,_|Then he bound together the middle with flax and the inmost with wax,|
|_atque ita compositas parvo curvamine flectit,_|And so he bends the constructions with a small curve,|
|_ut veras imitetur aves. Puer Icarus una_|As if he were copying real birds. The boy Icarus|
|_stabat et, ignarus sua se tractare pericla,_|stood there and ignorant of his own danger in handling things|
|_ore renidenti modo, quas vaga moverat aura,_|with his mouth gleaming, which by the wandering breeze|
|_captabat plumas, flavam modo pollice ceram_|plumes moved, he would catch, and with thumb the golden wax|
|_mollibat lusuque suo mirabile patris_|Soften and playing with his father's marvelous|
|_impediebat opus. Postquam manus ultima coepto_|Work impede. After the hand by the last undertaking|
|_imposita est, geminas opifex libravit in alas_|Was set down, the workman balanced into twin wings|
|_ipse suum corpus motaque pependit in aura._|His own body and he hung in the stirring wind.|
|_Instruit et natum "medio" que "ut limite curras,_|He teaches also his son, "You should run in the middle as the path,"|
|_Icare," ait, "moneo, ne, si demissior ibis_|"Icarus," he says, "I warn you, if lower, you fly|
|_unda gravet pennas, si celsior, ignis adurat_|the wave will weigh down the feathers, if higher, the sun would scorch them|
|_Inter utrumque vola. Nec te spectare Booten_|Fly between either. And that you not look at Bootes|
|_aut Helicen iubeo strictumque Orionis ensem:_|Or Helicen, I ask, or the sword of Orion|
|_me duce carpe viam." Pariter praecepta volandi_|With me as leader, take the way." Likewise, the lessons of that which must be flown|
|_tradit et ignotas umeris accomodat alas_.|He hands over and adjusts the unknown wings onto the shoulders.|
|_Inter opus monitusque genae maduere seniles_|During the work and the warnings, the old cheeks dripped with tears|
|_et patriae temuere manus. Dedit oscula nato_|And the hands of the father trembled. He gave kisses to his son|
|_non iterum repetenda suo, pennisque levatus_|That would not be returned to him again, and supported by wings|
|_ante volat comitique timet, velut ales, ab alto_|First he flies and fears for his companion, as if a bird from a high|
|_quae teneram prolem produxit in aera nido_|nest who led forth in air young offspring|
|_hortaturque sequi damnosasque erudit artes_|And urges them to follow and teaches them the ruinous art|
|_et movet ipse suas et nati respicit alas_|And moves her own by herself and looks back on the wings of her child|
|_Hos aliquis tremula dum captat harundine pisces_|Trembling while she captures these fish by some reed|
|_aut pastor baculo stivave innixus arator_|And the shepherd resting on a stick or, if you like, a farmer|
|_vidit et obstipuit quique aethera carpere possent_|Saw and was amazed by they who could seize heaven|
|_credidit esse deos. Et iam Iunonia laeva_|And he believed them to be gods. And now on the left Junonian|
|_parte Samos (fuerant Delosque Parosque relictae)_|Samos (both Delos and Paros were left behind)|
|_dextra Lebinthos erat fecundaque melle Calymne_|On the right was Lebinthos and Calymne abundant in honey|
|_cum puer audaci coepit gaudere volatu_|When the boy began to rejoice in bold flight|
|_deseruitque ducem caelique cupidine tractus_|And he left the leader and dragged by desire of the sky|
|_altius egit iter. Rapidi vicinia solis_|He goes a higher path. The nearness of the swift sun|
|_mollit odoratas, pennarum vincula, ceras_|Softens the fragrant wax, the chains of the wings|
|_Tabuerant cerae: nudos quatit ille lacertos,_|Had melted of wax: The boy shakes his bare arms|
|_remigioque carens non ullas percipit auras_|And lacking oarage he does not secure the wind|
|_oraque caerulea patrium clamantia nomen_|The his mouth's shouting of the name of the father by the blue|
|_excipiuntur aqua: quae nomen traxit ab illo_|Sea is received: which name it got from him.|
|_At pater infelix nec iam pater 'Icare' dixit_|But the unlucky father is now not a father, "Icarus," he said|
|_'Icare' dixit, 'ubi es? qua te regione requiram'_|"Icarus," he said, "Where are you? Where should I find you?"|
|_"Icare," dicebat: pennas adspexit in undis_|"Icarus," he kept saying: he saw the wings in waves|
|_devovitque suas artes corpusque sepulcro_|And cursed his own arts and the body in a tomb|
|_condidit, et tellus a nomine dicta sepulti_|He places and the ground was called by the name of the burial.|
|_Hunc miseri tumulo ponentem corpora nati_|The bodies of the poor son on this foundation in the tomb|
|_garrula limoso prospexit ab elice perdix_|Swampy, the chatty partridge foresaw from the drain|
|_et plausit pennis testataque gaudia cantu est_|And beat its wings and is bearing witness in a happy song|
