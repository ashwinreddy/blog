|_Daedalus interea Creten longumque perosus_|Daedalus, meanwhile, loathing Crete and the long|
|_exsilium tactusque loci natalis amore_|Exile, influenced by love of his homeland,|
|_clausus erat pelago. "Terras licet" inquit "et undas"_|Was trapped by the sea. Granted, he said, that earth and sea|
|_obstruat: at caelum certe patet; ibimus illac._|Block me. But the sky certainly is open; We shall go that way.|
|_Omnia possideat, non possidet aera Minos._|Minos might own everything, he can't own the air.|
|_Dixit et ignotas animum dimittit in artes_|He said this and turned his mind to unknown arts|
|_naturamque novat. Nam ponit in ordine pennas_|And he changed nature. For he placed wings in rows|
|_a minima coeptas, longam breviore sequenti,_|Undertaken by the smallest, with the shorter following the longer|
|_ut clivo crevisse putes. Sic rustica quondam_|So that you would think they grew like that, on a slant. Like that, once, a rustic|
|_fistula disparibus paulatim surgit avenis._|Pipe little by little grows, made by unequal reeds.|

|_captabat plumas, flavam modo pollice ceram_|plumes moved, he would catch, and with thumb the golden wax|
|_mollibat lusuque suo mirabile patris_|Soften and playing with his father's marvelous|
|_impediebat opus. Postquam manus ultima coepto_|Work impede. After the hand by the last undertaking|
|_imposita est, geminas opifex libravit in alas_|Was set down, the workman balanced into twin wings|
|_ipse suum corpus motaque pependit in aura._|His own body and he hung in the stirring wind.|
|_Instruit et natum "medio" que "ut limite curras,_|He teaches also his son, "You should run in the middle as the path,"|
|_Icare," ait, "moneo, ne, si demissior ibis_|"Icarus," he says, "I warn you, lest if you would go down low|
