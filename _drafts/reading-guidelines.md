title: "My Reading Philosophy"
---

Over the last few years, I've spent quite a lot of time reading. Naturally, I've developed thoughts, based on my own taste, to prevent certain failure modes and cultivate a more fruitful experience. 

First, one must have books worth reading. But suppose nothing comes to mind. In that case, I would suggest picking any classic book that catches your fancy. A classic is a book that is well-known and well-respected, so you can find classics in virtually any genre you like. 



I subscribe to [reading a lot with a strong filter](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/how-to-read-lots-of-inputs-and-a-strong-filter/). That is, to "start many books and finish few of them." Where do I find books?

* During Wikipedia rabbit holes.
* Browsing [Five Books](https://fivebooks.com/), in which each article is an interview with an expert recommending 5 books on a topic.
* Reading [The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/) articles.
* Looking for more books by authors I enjoy.
* Looking for books inspired by or that inspired other books I like.
