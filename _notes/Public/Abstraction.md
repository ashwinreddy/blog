Abstraction is thinking about a system in terms of interface -- its inputs and outputs. An abstraction is said to be leaky if it requires the user to understand the internal mechanism to use it. This [[Metaphor]] likens an abstraction to a sealant. An ideal abstraction firmly separates the mechanism from the interface. However, [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) says

> All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.
