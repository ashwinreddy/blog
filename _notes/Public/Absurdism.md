Absurdism is the philosophical position that the universe has no coherent meaning, that meaning is not a sensible dimension. It is most closely connected to Albert Camus. In his book [The Myth of Sisyphus](https://www.worldcat.org/title/myth-of-sisyphus-and-other-essays/oclc/616928), he states that the primary philosopical problem is deciding whether life is worth living or not. 

In particular, Camus notes a tension between human minds and the universe. The mind wants to find coherence in its understanding and therefore seeks it out in the world. But reality does not conform to any such coherence. Past philosophers like Kierkegaard get around this by introducing a leap of faith. Camus finds this an invalid line of reasoning.

I believe absurdism is a flawed but noteworthy response to [[Chaos]].
