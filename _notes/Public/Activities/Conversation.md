> The profit in good conversation is something learned.[^adler]

> One person seeks a midwife for his thoughts; the other, someone he can assist. Here is the origin of a good conversation -- Nietzsche

Conversation is an [[Activity]] of using [[Language]] for [[Cooperation]] with [[Information]]. The cooperative principle, differentiated into Grice's maxims, tells us that people expect:

|Maxim|Meaning|
|-------|---------|
|Quantity|Inform as much as required, but no more|
|Quality|Say only what is true or that for which you have evidence|
|Relevance|Say only what pertains to this exchange|
|Clarity|Be perspicuous|

But there are reasons to doubt Grice's maxims. [Like what?]
