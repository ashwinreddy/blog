Philosophy (Greek _philos_ for loving + _sophia_ for wisdom) can mean many things, but here are definitions worth thinking about. 

1. Philosophy is the creation of concepts. This is the view taken up by [[Deleuze]] & Guattari. D&G say in [[What is Philosophy?]] that philosophy is not about contemplation, reflection, or communication, although it involves those things. 
2. Philosophy is a way of life. This is the view taken by [[Seneca]]. 
3. Philosophy is therapy.
4. Philosophy is a discussion.


Because philosophy is a social [[Activity]], it depends a great deal on [[Language]] and on [[Reading]] and [[Writing]]. 

## How to read philosophy

Ellie Anderson has [good advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pj26s8u6Vo):

* Rely on solid sources like [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html).
* Skim-and-slog. First skim a portion, then closely read it. 
* Annotate after you've finished a portion. 
* Take some notes after a reading session. 
* Watch out for logical moves being made. 
* Resist your first -- and second -- urge to stop reading. 
* Learn to swim.
