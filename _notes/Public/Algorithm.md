An algorithm (from the name al-Khwarizmi) is a mechanical recipe backed up by empirical evidence and/or proof of desirable properties. Desirable properties include guaranteed correctness, minimal usage of resources like memory space or compute time. 

The key power of an algorithm lies not in the recipe but in the support, which enables us to use the algorithm as an [[Abstraction]]. In particular, we can set up a [[Machine]] to run the algorithm without further concern.

* Leslie Lamport reminds us that algorithms are meant to be read by humans. That makes them a part of [[Language]].
