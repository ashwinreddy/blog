> All art is quite useless. -- Oscar Wilde

The Greeks spoke of art as mimesis, mimicking nature. The German idealists ([[Kant]] and [[Schiller]]) saw art as a form of [[Play]]. 

> Art is a [[Human]] activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings, and also experience them. -- Tolstoy

We could stretch this view to say that [[Art]] is [[Sprachspiel]] of the most [[Meaningness]]. 


In [[What is Philosophy?]], Deleuze and Guattari suggest Art is a response to [[Chaos]].


We cannot neglect the Time in which an artwork was created in judging it.
