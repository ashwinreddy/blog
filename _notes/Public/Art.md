> All art is quite useless. -- Oscar Wilde

The Greeks spoke of art as mimesis, mimicking nature. The German idealists ([[Kant]] and [[Schiller]]) saw art as a form of [[Play]]. 

> Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings, and also experience them. -- Tolstoy

[[What is Philosophy?]] says art is a response to [[Chaos]].
