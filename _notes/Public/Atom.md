An atom (_Greek_ for indivisible) is a unit of [[Matter]] in [[Physics]]. 

> If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the _atomic hypothesis_ (or the atomic _fact_, or whatever you wish to call it) that _all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another_. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an _enormous_ amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.[^feynman-atom]
