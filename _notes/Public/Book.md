Books may well be the most advanced [[Technology]] we have. It stands for four types of technology: object, content, idea, interface. 

It is the recorded [[Medium]] for thought through [[Reading]] and [[Writing]].

In [The Book](https://www.worldcat.org/title/book/oclc/1004091449&referer=brief_results), Amaranth Borsuk says books first began as clay tablets with cuneiform (cuneis for wedge) writing in Sumer because clay was readily available in Mesopotamia (Greek for "between two river," referring to Tigris and Euphrates). Over time, the Sumerians evolved the technology by flattening the tablets, introducing a stylus, and moving from pictographic to syllabic writing, facilitating further [[Abstraction]]. Ashurbanipal had a collection of more than 30,000 tablets of documents relating to medicine, science, and mathematics as well as the epic of Gilgamesh.

Egyptians, who made extensive use of _cyperus papyrus_, wrote with hieroglyphs. They had water-soluble charcoal black ink and red ink from oxidized iron. They had sheets around the size of office paper today, but they glued the sheets in rolls of twenty. They would write on one side, and it would curl up. This is the scroll as we know it. Rubrication, the method of using red ink for annotations, became popular.
