Buddhism is a religion and [[Philosophy]] started by Siddhartha Gautama, the [[Buddha]]. Buddhism has much to say about [[Consciousness]] among other things. 

[[Vervaeke]] reads the first noble truth not as the idea that one is always in pain but as the fact that the threat of self-deception always looms over us. 

There is Mahayana and Theravada schools.
