Causation is the [[Abstraction]] whereby a temporally antecedent cause drives a proceeding effect. The notion of [[Time]] is therefore quite important here. Thinkers of causation include [[Aristotle]] and [[Leibniz]], who believes in the PSR.

: Everything must have a cause

[[Hume]] has a critique of causation.
