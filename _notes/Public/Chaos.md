Chaos is a primordial force of disorder. In its purest, original sense, it is described by classic figures like Hesiod, Aristophanes, Socrates, Aristotle, and Ovid. The Christian version of chaos is outlined by [[Milton]]. I also like Edna St. Vincent Millay's sonnet and Nolan's Joker. Nassim Taleb has catalogued Chaos neatly:

> uncertainty; variability; imperfect, incomplete knowledge; chance; chaos; volatility; disorder; [[Entropy]]; [[Time]]; the unknown; randomness; turmoil; stressor; error; dispersion of outcomes; unknowledge. -- [[Antifragile]]
