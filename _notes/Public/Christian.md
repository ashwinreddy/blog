A Christian is one involved in Christianity, the [[Religion]] that believes in the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth as son of [[God]]. Since Jesus was Jewish, it has many similarities with Judaism. But even mainline Christianity incorporates ideas from [[Plato]] and [[Stoicism]]. 

In Christianity, [[Death]] takes you to an afterlife or heaven if you're good and hell if you're bad.
