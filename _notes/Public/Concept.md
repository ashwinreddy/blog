In _[[What is Philosophy?]]_, a concept is a creation (act of [[Creativity]]) that testifies to the positive power of thinking as an [[event]] of [[Life]]. [[Philosophy]] creates concepts and puts them to work. [[Gilles Deleuze]] (and [[Guattari]]) think that the concept of Forms in [[Platonism]], for example, does not help us understand the richness of our own experience but merely creates abstract objects which are ordered, ranked, labeled. 

Concepts should help us think of new possibilities, productive connections. A concept has to be particular to its circumstances. The concept helps us think about an experience by moving beyond it and thinking it anew. That's why concepts have to be creative and active. Deleuze, for example, says Hume's view of [[Causation]] is a concept.
