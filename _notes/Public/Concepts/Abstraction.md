Abstraction is a fundamental technique in thinking about [[System]]s where we treat the system as a black box. In other words, we only think about the system in terms of its interface -- its inputs and outputs. Abstraction is a core idea in computer science. 

An abstraction is said to be leaky if it requires the user to understand the internal mechanism to use it. This [[Metaphor]] likens an abstraction to a sealant. An ideal abstraction firmly separates the mechanism from the interface. However, [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) says

> All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.
