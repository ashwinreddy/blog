An algorithm (from the name al-Khwarizmi) is a mechanical recipe with desirable guarantees of correctness and/or efficiency. The benefit of an algorithm is that once we verify the algorithm's guarantees, we can use it without further thought. In this way, an algorithm's proof turns it into an [[Abstraction]]. 

In particular, we can set up a [[Machine]] to run the algorithm in an automated fashion. 

Leslie Lamport reminds us that algorithms are meant to be read by humans. That makes them a part of [[Language]].
