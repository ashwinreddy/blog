An algorithm (from the name al-Khwarizmi) is a mechanical recipe with empirical evidence and/or proof of desirable properties, typically relating to correctness and/or efficiency. The latter condition enables us to use the algorithm as an [[Abstraction]]. In particular, we can set up a [[Machine]] to run the algorithm without further concern.

* Leslie Lamport reminds us that algorithms are meant to be read by humans. That makes them a part of [[Language]].
