Regarding the term, from Douglas Hofstadter's _[Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies](https://www.worldcat.org/title/fluid-concepts-and-creative-analogies-computer-models-of-the-fundamental-mechanism-of-thought/oclc/878792231&referer=brief_results)_:

> In the 1970's, I enthusiastically embraced this provocative phrase (or its acronym, "AI") as a good way of describing my field of research and my own goals. For me and probably a good many other people, the term conjured up an exciting image -- that of questing after the deepest secrets of the human mind and expressing them as pure, abstract patterns. In the early 1980's, however, that term, as words are wont to do, gradually started changing connotations, and began to exude the flavor of commercial applications and expert systems, as opposed to basic scientific research about the nature of thinking and being conscious. Then, even worse, it slid down the slope that ends up in meaningless buzzwords and empty hype. As a result I came to feel much less comfortable saying or writing "AI".
