> I will put Chaos into fourteen lines  
And keep him there; and let him thence escape  
If he be lucky; let him twist, and ape  
Flood, fire, and demon --- his adroit designs  
Will strain to nothing in the strict confines  
Of this sweet order, where, in pious rape,  
I hold his essence and amorphous shape,  
Till he with Order mingles and combines.  
Past are the hours, the years of our duress,  
His arrogance, our awful servitude:  
I have him. He is nothing more nor less  
Than something simple not yet understood;  
I shall not even force him to confess;  
Or answer. I will only make him good. -- Edna St. Vincent Millay

Chaos is disorder and confusion. For that reason, it is difficult to define simply, but Nassim Taleb's catalogue from [[Antifragile]] captures it.
