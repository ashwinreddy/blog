A classic book is one that has left a lasting impact on its culture, that is still read today, and/or from a classical period in that culture. In [this video](https://youtu.be/cVLpdzhcU0g?t=547), Jeffrey Brenzel defines 5 criteria of a classic.

1. Addresses permanent and universal human concerns
2. Changed perspective on the issue
3. Influences other great works
4. Respected by experts
5. Challenging yet rewarding.

Since great books influence other great books, they form a [[Graph]]. 

## Classic = Great?
Some people think that the criteria imply that a classic book is a great one and that a good education involves reading classic books. I would count myself among these people, along with Mortimer Adler and [certainly](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3292030) Thomas [[Jefferson]]. If you're interested, [Read The Great Books](https://www.readthegreatbooks.com/) is a nice resource.
