An explanation is an account of why or how for something. An explanation usually includes causal relations, which brings in the question of [[Causality]]. In Aristotelian theory, there are 4 causes that help explain why.

1. Material cause. Because of what it is made of. 
2. Formal cause
3. Efficient cause. 
4. Final cause. Because that's what it is or aims for.
