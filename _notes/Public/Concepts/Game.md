> A game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles. -- Bernard Suits

Can we define what a game is? [[Wittgenstein]] doesn't think so, but Bernard Suits has a suitable definition.

> To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs [prelusory goal], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means], where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity [lusory attitude]

This definition and the one outlined in Mark Rosewater's [What is a game?](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/what-game-2018-06-04) point to 4 components. The ablation lists what the game minus that component is.

|Component|Meaning|Ablation|
|---------|-------|--------|
|[[Agency]]|Players get to make meaningful choices|Event|
|Goals|Players aim for a well-defined state of affairs|Toy|
|Restriction|Rules block easy, obvious choices|[[Activity]]|
|Lack of relevance|A game is played purely for fun|Life|

Finally, we need [[Playfulness]]. To be a good [[Human]], we have to know which games [exist](https://www.autodidacts.io/what-game-are-you-playing/) and are worth playing. An important game that people play is the [status game](https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/who-wants-to-play-the-status-game-agnes-callard/#).
