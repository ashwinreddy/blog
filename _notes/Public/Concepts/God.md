God seems to be a concept created and discussed by humans for as long as we've been alive wherever we've been alive. The term is a little hollow because people have used it to mean different things. The god of philosophers is not the same as the god of religion.

The Greek gods are powerful emotions. The Judaic God is one who seems very interested in divine justice. The Christian God cares about mercy.
