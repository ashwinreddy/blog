God is a concept created by humans for maybe as long as we've been alive wherever we've been alive. It means different things to different people. The god of philosophers is not the same as the god of religion. Most god-talk is therefore just equivocating.

The Greek gods are powerful emotions. The Judaic God is one who seems very interested in divine justice. The Christian God cares about mercy. 

God also poses some strange questions about [[Free Will]].
