_[Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/)_ is a book describing the eponymous quality of having meaning as well as the study of this quality and a [[Stance]] that acknowledges it. When we talk about the meaning of _X_, we are employing a [[Metaphor]] between _X_ and [[Language]] acts. For example, a sentence has meaning insofar as it talks about something in a sensible, coherent fashion so that all the parts hang together logically. Meaningness is a phenomenon of [[Emergence]]. One phoneme or syllable lacks meaning on its own just as an atom lacks meaning. Thus, meaning arises when the atoms are put together in sensible but interesting ways.
