Metaphor is a device found in [[Language]] that imbues one thing, the tenor, with a sense of another, the vehicle. For example, in "all the world's a stage," the world is the tenor and stage is the vehicle.  In [Metaphors We Live By](https://www.worldcat.org/title/metaphors-we-live-by/oclc/1050036394&referer=brief_results), George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argue that far from being just a literary device, metaphor is core to how [[Language]] operates. Steven Pinker's [Stuff of Thought](https://www.worldcat.org/title/stuff-of-thought/oclc/1267996041&referer=brief_results) also makes this case. A nice list of [metaphors in man pages](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/05/08/metaphors-in-man-pages/) here.

* A metaphor has to have the right distance between the tenor and vehicle. If the objects are too close, the metaphor doesn't bring out any insight. If they are too far away, it feels contrived.
* A metaphor is usually not reversible. You can say "life is a highway," but "a highway is life" sounds strange.
