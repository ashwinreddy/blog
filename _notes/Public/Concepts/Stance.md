A [stance](https://meaningness.com/stances-nature-toc) is a pattern people use to think about [[Meaningness]]. We care about stances because people rarely follow a system, philosophical or otherwise. The extremes are Eternalism, which says everything has meaning, and [[Nihilism]], which says nothing has meaning.

We can compare the two stances in a [table](https://meaningness.com/all-dimensions-schematic-overview).
