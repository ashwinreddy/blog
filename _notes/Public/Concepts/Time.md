> _Tempus edax rerax_ (Time, greedy of all things). -- [[Metamorphoses]]

Newton spoke of absolute time, which is the same everywhere and passes in a linear fashion. This is a good model for science, engineering, and organizing society. However, it's not what physics tells us happens in truth. In general relativity, spacetime is a manifold where space and time cannot be decoupled. Where space bends, time does too. Nor is it how people experience time. [[Phenomenology]] reveals to us that we have an independent, subjective experience of time. Moreover, we have the sense that time is a resource. In English, there is a [[Metaphor]] that time is [[Money]]. You can spend time or waste it. Someone can live on borrowed time.
