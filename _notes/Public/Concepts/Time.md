In Newtonian physics, we take time to be linear. In general relativity, spacetime is a manifold where space and time cannot be decoupled. Phenomenology shows us that we don't experiece time as linear.

In English, there is a [[Metaphor]] that time is [[Money]]. You can spend time or waste it. Someone can live on borrowed time. 


There is an A-Theory of Time and a B-Theory of Time.
