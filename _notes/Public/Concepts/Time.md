* [Why is Time a One-Way Street?](# Why is Time a One-Way Street?)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhnKBKZvb_U)
* In Newtonian physics, we take time to be linear. 
* In general relativity, spacetime is a manifold where space and time cannot be decoupled. 
* Phenomenology shows us that we don't experience time as linear.
* In English, there is a [[Metaphor]] that time is [[Money]]. You can spend time or waste it. Someone can live on borrowed time. 
* There is an A-Theory of Time and a B-Theory of Time.
