Deterritorialization is a concept from [[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]. First, we have to understand territorialization, which is the connection of forces to produce wholes. These forces can also act to alter, mutate, or destroy the whole, which is deterritorialization. There can also be reterritorialization, which is when the deterritorialized term returns.
