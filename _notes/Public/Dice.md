Dice are a [[Symbol]] of probability. When Caesar said _alea iacta est_, he meant that there was no going back. Chance had played its part, whatever it was. [[Nietzsche]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]] think about the dicethrow in two movements. First, the dice are thrown on earth. Second, the dice fall back in heaven. The dicethrower, like Caesar, is supposed to affirm chance. It is bad manners, like Shakuni, to use loaded dice.
