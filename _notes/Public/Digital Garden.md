A digital garden is a digital space that we cultivate. You're looking at my digital garden right now. Digital gardens are similar to Wikis and [Zettelkastens](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/), but the garden [[Metaphor]] is vivid and lovely. Maybe you should make one too, so you can [[Show Your Work]]. Make sure to [Write plain text files](https://sive.rs/plaintext). 

The basic unit of a digital garden is an evergreen note. 
* One note = one unit of knowledge work, based around a concept or big idea. 
* Notes link to each other, forming a graph.

A digital garden isn't complete without an antilibrary to go with it.
