An epic poem is a narrative [[Poem]] of great length about extraordinary or larger-than-life characters. Ezra Pound said it was a poem including history. In [A preface to Paradise Lost](https://www.worldcat.org/title/preface-to-paradise-lost/oclc/1269090815&referer=brief_results), C.S. Lewis categorizes _[[Paradise Lost]]_ as a secondary epic, in the sense that it is a literary production rather than an oral tradition.

> The epic, as Renaissance critics understood it, is a narrative poem of heroic action, but a special kind of narrative. It also has an encyclopaedic quality in it, distilling the essence of all the religious, philosophical, political, even scientific learnings of its time, and, if completely successful, the definitive poem for its age.  -- Angus Fletcher

The epic poem is primarily a form for high literature and many epic poems have become [[Classic]]s and part of the [[Canon]].
