title: "Free Will"

Free will is the idea that people are responsible for their actions. Our society is built on this assumption, so there are massive ramifications in all cases, whether we decide free will certainly exists, partially exists, or does not exist. Religious, scientific, and philosophical thinking all have an interest in the debate as well. 

I feel Schopenhauer understood the core problem.

> A man can do as he wills, but not will as he wills. 

A thorough discussion of free will will also have to touch on [[Causality]].
