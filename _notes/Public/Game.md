The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein didn't think that "game" had a clear definition. Although the set of games is quite large and diverse, it is incorrect to say there is no definition. Bernard Suits' definition is good.

> A game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.

This is only a portable definition, so it needs some expanding.

> To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs [prelusory goal], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means], where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity [lusory attitude]

This definition and the one outlined in Mark Rosewater's [What is a game?](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/what-game-2018-06-04) point to 4 components. The ablation lists what the game minus that component is.


|Component|Meaning|Ablation|
|---------|-------|--------|
|Agency|Players get to make meaningful choices|Event|
|Goals|Players aim for a well-defined state of affairs|Toy|
|Restriction|Rules block easy, obvious choices|Activity|
|Lack of relevance|A game is played purely for fun|Life|
