> Very few great scientists have written interestingly, and these few have usually felt apologetic about it. Yet sooner or later the time will come when the mighty sweep of modern scientific discovery will be placed, by scientific men with the gift of expression, at the service of intelligent and cultivated laymen. Another writer of "Canterbury Tales," another singer of "Paradise Lost," could not add more to the sum of literary achievement than the man who may picture to us the phases of the age-long history of life on this globe, or make vivid before our eyes the tremendous march of the worlds through space. -- Theodore Roosevelt, History as Literature

> But those who criticize without creating, those who are content to defend the vanished concept without being able to give it the forces it needs to return to life, are the plague of philosophy. -- [[What is Philosophy?]]

> Blessedness is not the reward of virtue, but is virtue itself; and we do not delight in it because we conquer our passions, but because we delight in it, we are able to conquer our passions. -- [[Spinoza's Ethics]]


> Am I to refuse to eat because I do not fully understand the mechanism of digestion? -- Heaviside

> What I propose, therefore, is very simple: it is nothing more than to think what we are doing. -- Arendt

|_Non est philosophia populare artificium nec ostentationi paratum. Non in verbis, sed in rebus est. Nec in hoc adhibetur, ut cum aliqua oblectatione consumatur dies, ut dematur otio nausia. Animum format et fabricat, vitam disponit, actiones regit, agenda et omittenda demonstrat, sedet ad gubernaculum et per ancipitia fluctuantium derigit cursum. Sine hac nemo intrepide potest vivere, nemo secure. Innumerabilia accidunt singulis horis, quae consilium exigant, quod ab hac petendum est._|Philosophy is not a popular trick nor equipment for showing off. It exists not in words but in deeds. And it is not put to use in this, so that the day is consumed with some delight, so that nausia surrenders to leisure. It forms and constructs the mind, lays down life, rules actions, shows what is to be done and what is to be left out, it sits at the helm and directs the course through the uncertainties of hesitating. Without it, nobody can live without fear, nobody untroubled. Countless things happen each hour that call for help, which must be sought from philosophy. |
