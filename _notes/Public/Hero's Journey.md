The Hero's Journey or Monomyth is a global narrative pattern in [[Myth]] and [[Literature]] found by Joseph Campbell. It is described in his book _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_. Similar patterns can be found, e.g. kish≈çtenketsu. The Hero has to confront [[Chaos]].

Showrunner and writer Dan Harmon has adapted the hero's journey into a simplified form he calls the story circle.
