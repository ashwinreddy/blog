The Hero's Journey or Monomyth is a global pattern in [[Myth]] and storytelling found by Joseph Campbell. It is described in his book _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_. Similar patterns can be found, e.g. kish≈çtenketsu.

The guardian is usually some form of [[Sage]].



Showrunner and writer Dan Harmon has adapted the hero's journey into a simplified form he calls the story circle.
