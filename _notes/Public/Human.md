A human could be _Homo sapiens_, _Homo ludens_, _Homo faber_, _animal laborans_, _animal ridens_. 

Humans are [[Technologist]]s supreme, responding to [[Chaos]] not with wings or claws but [[Technology]] that extends our body in place of such adaptations. We create [[Abstraction]]s to manage [[Information]] and [[Meaningness]] such as in [[Art]], [[Philosophy]], [[Science]], [[Language]], and [[Game]]s. We organize ourselves socially with concepts like [[Free Will]] and causality and justice. We engage in [[Cooperation]].  Yet each of us has an individual personality that we use to contribute to the larger project of being human. We do this in a self-reinforcing fashion, through education. Once in a while, one of us becomes a [[Sage]] and tells us something important. In this, we may be lucky enough to reach some eudaimonia. 

My understanding of what a human is has been greatly informed by my [[Personal Canon]].
