A human could be _Homo sapiens_, _Homo ludens_, _Homo faber_, _animal laborans_, _animal ridens_. 

Humans are [[Technologist]]. We create [[Abstraction]]s to manage [[Information]] and [[Meaningness]] such as in [[Art]], [[Philosophy]], [[Science]], [[Language]], and [[Game]]s. We engage in [[Cooperation]].  Yet each of us has an individual personality that we use to contribute to the larger project of being human. We do this in a self-reinforcing fashion, through education. Once in a while, one of us becomes a [[Sage]] and tells us something important. In this, we may be lucky enough to reach some eudaimonia.
