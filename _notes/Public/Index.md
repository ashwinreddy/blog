An index is something that points. This index points to some trains of thought that I'm working on.

## _Amor Ludi_

What does it mean to play for the love of the [[Game]]? There's something to be learned from [[Existentialism]] without making [[Meaningness]] a pivotal question of life. Some combination of investigating [[Vervaeke]]'s ideas and [[Amor fati]] is needed.

## Books and Mediums

There's something special about [[Reading]] and [[Writing]] as [[Technology]] of the [[Sign]] (see [[Technologies of the Self]]). The [[Book]] is an extremely interesting object and [[Medium]]. But why and how? [[Borges]] and Eco laid a path, but what did they say, and can more be said?

## Stoicism

What are the core principles of a [[Stoic]], leaning on influences like [[Christianity]] and downstream philosophers like [[Gilles Deleuze]] as well as finding the best in light of comparison with [[Buddhism]]?

## Chaos

[[Chaos]] and [[Entropy]] and [[Information]]. They're connected, but how?

## Mindfulness

What can be said about [[Meditation]], [[Mindfulness]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Consciousness]]?
