Interpretation is the act of making [[Meaningness]] in any [[System]] that shows [[Emergence]]. 

In Edward Tufte's _Visual Explanations_, he uses John Snow's visual analysis of the cholera outbreak from _On the Mode of Communication of Cholera_, which helped solve the cholera epidemic. On the other hand, the Challenger disaster showed how the displays need to tell a clear story.

> There are right ways and wrong ways to show data; there are displays that reveal the truth and displays that do not. -- Tufte
