> Interpretation is the revenge of the intellect upon art. Even more. It is the revenge of the intellect upon the world. -- Sontag

Interpretation is the [[Activity]] of finding or analyzing (Greek for loosening) [[Meaningness]]. Interpretation typically occurs with loose rules, which makes it apt to be called a [[Sprachspiel]]. Some things generate more complex meaning than others; interpretation must deal with [[Emergence]] at some point or another. 

[[Art]] can require interpretation. For [[Literature]], [[Literary criticism]] is the field that looks at its interpretation.
