The labyrinth is a common motif in [[Myth]]. The most well-known story is that of Theseus and the Minotaur, who was trapped in a labyrinth invented by [[Daedalus]]. Theseus was only able to navigate the maze by means of a thread which he was given by Ariadne. The word "clue" in English originally meant a ball of thread, which gives us its standard meaning today.
