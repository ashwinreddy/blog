Life is the primary [[Activity]] studied by [[Biology]]. When we talk about life, we're often interested in that of a [[Human]]. 

## Is Life a Game? 

If and only if we think its obstacles are unnecessary and have the appropriate lusory attitude to think that. But, as Raymond Geuss objects, life often involves a great deal of struggle and difficulty and is not always fun.[^game] Worse still, the goal and the rules are often unclear, which vitiates the activity. When the goal is clear, it is often the case that we are working with nested goals. Hence, games are a simplistic lens with which to view life.
