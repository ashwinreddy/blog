Life is the primary [[Activity]] studied by [[Biology]]. When we talk about life, we're often interested in that of a [[Human]]. 


## Is Life a Game? 

Occasionally, someone will describe life as a [[Game]]. This is not far from the truth, as a game is only slightly differentiated from an [[Activity]]. But, as Raymond Geuss objects, life often involves a great deal of struggle and difficulty and is not always fun.[^game] The goal and the rules are often unclear. When the goal is clear, it is often the case that we are working with nested goals. Hence, games are a simplistic lens with which to view life.
