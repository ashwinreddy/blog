The Greek word _logos_ is an important and complicated one, meaning speech or reason. In [[Christianity]], it came to mean the word of God. The best example is John 1:1

> En arkhêi ên ho lógos, kaì ho lógos ên pròs tòn theón, kaì theòs ên ho lógos.

It shows up in Heraclitus and in [[Stoic]] philosophy.
