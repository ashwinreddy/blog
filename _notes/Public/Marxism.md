Marxism is a school of [[Philosophy]], Economics, and [[History]] as well as an [[Ideology]] that develops from the thoughts of [[Marx]] about [[Capitalism]]. It contains a material [[Dialectic]] about labor. 

In it, history is conceieved through class struggle. There are two classes: the bourgeois and the proletariat. The capitalist and his workers. In industrial capitalism, the worker is alienated from his labor, and there is commodity fetishism. But if the workers seize the means of production, they can form together.
