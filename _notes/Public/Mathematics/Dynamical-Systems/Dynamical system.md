a dynamical system is a [[tuple]] $(T, X, \Phi)$. $\Phi$ is the **evolution [[function]]**. 

$$
\begin{align}
& \Phi(0, x) = x \\
&\Phi(t_{2}, \Phi(t_{1}, x)) = \Phi(t_{2}+ t_{1}, x)
\end{align}
$$

when a dynamical system becomes hard to predict, it enters the realm of [[chaos theory]]. 

many people say [[poincare]] founded dynamical systems. 

often, we will upgrade $X$ from [[set]] to [[manifold]] $\mathcal{M}$.
