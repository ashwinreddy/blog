Meaningness refers to the quality of having meaning as well as the [book](https://meaningness.com/) that defines the term. It can also mean the study or ideas of this quality and a stance that properly acknowledges it. 

When we talk about the meaning of _X_, we are employing a [[Metaphor]] between _X_ and, say, a sentence. A sentence has meaning insofar as it talks about something in a sensible, coherent fashion so that all the parts hang together logically.
