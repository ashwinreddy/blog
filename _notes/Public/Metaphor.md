A metaphor is a linguistic device that imbues one thing, the tenor, with a sense of another, the vehicle. For example, in "all the world's a stage," the world is the tenor and stage is the vehicle.  In _Metaphors We Live By_, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argue that far from being just a literary device, metaphor is core to how language operates.
