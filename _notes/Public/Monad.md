The monad is a [[Concept]] from [[Leibniz]] of a self-sufficient substance prior to relations. Each monad has its own perspective. For [[Gilles Deleuze]], there are 2 key ideas here:

1. The whole of life is nothing more than a plane of perceptions
2. We perceive our world in terms of the relations from our point of view.
