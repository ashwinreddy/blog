Mythology is [[Literature]] of the spirit. Archetypal patterns include [[The Prince Returns]] and [[Hero's Journey]] and creation myths.  

Proto-Indo-European myth covers and generalizes a vast swath of mythological stories. An interesting one is _Chaoskampf_ (struggle against [[Chaos]]), often involving a serpent-slaying hero.
