Mythology is [[Literature]] of the spirit. It's about stories from our symbolic past. It's neither [[Science]] nor [[Metaphor]]. 

Some myths are etiological, that is they serve as an [[Explanation]] of some kind. These are called just-so or _pourquoi_ stories.



Archetypal patterns include [[The Prince Returns]] and [[Hero's Journey]] and creation myths.  

Proto-Indo-European myth covers and generalizes a vast swath of mythological stories. An interesting one is _Chaoskampf_ (struggle against [[Chaos]]), often involving a serpent-slaying hero.
