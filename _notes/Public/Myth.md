Myth is [[Literature]] of the spirit, stories of a [[Symbol]]ic past, neither [[Science]] nor [[Metaphor]]. Some myths are etiological, serving as an [[Explanation]] of some kind. These are called just-so or _pourquoi_ stories. But not all myths are like that.

Archetypal patterns in myth include the [[Hero's Journey]] and creation myths.  

Proto-Indo-European myth covers and generalizes a vast swath of mythological stories. An interesting one is _Chaoskampf_ (struggle against [[Chaos]]), often involving a serpent-slaying hero.
