> In all the wild imaginings of mythology a fanciful spirit is playing on the border-line between jest and earnest. -- Johan Huizinga

Mythology is [[Literature]] of the spirit. Archetypal patterns include [[The Prince Returns]] and [[Hero's Journey]] and [[Creation myth]].  

[[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] myth covers and generalizes a vast swath of mythological stories. An interesting one is _Chaoskampf_ (struggle against [[Chaos]]), often involving a serpent-slaying hero.
