Nihilism is the view that nothing matters.

> Nihilism as an “ideology of nothing” would mean not that we adhere to a discernible system of beliefs about nothingness, but rather that the beliefs we have, or think we have, are equivalent to nothing. -- Nolen Gertz

Gertz says nihilism starts with [[Allegory of the cave]], which is the possibility of a completely illusory life. The cave is dangerous. He sees [[Descartes]] as picking up that thread as well, then [[Hume]] who challenges the typical notions of seeing through reality. This brings [[Kant]] into the picture, rescuing knowledge from Hume. [[Nietzsche]] then comes in to diagnose the problem.
