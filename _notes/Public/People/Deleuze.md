Gilles Deleuze (1925-95) was a French philosopher. He was a prolific and influential writer, making use of a staggering number of thinkers and ideas before him. Having studied at Sorbonne, which emphasized close readings and history of philosophy with key figures like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant, he was equipped to write monographs on classic philosophers. His primary influences are [[Nietzsche]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Bergson]], but he also wrote about [[Kant]], [[Hume]], [[Foucault]], and Leibniz.

 In 1968, Deleuze published his _magnum opus_ _Difference and Repetition_, a "philosophy of difference" which one can read as a response to [[Heidegger]]'s _Being and Time_. In it, he tried to develop a philosophy of difference.
 
 
 Then, he collaborated with Felix Guattari. They wrote _Capitalism and Schizophrenia_ as well as [[What is Philosophy?]] together.
