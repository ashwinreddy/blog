Gilles Deleuze (1925-95) was a French [[Philosopher]] and a [[Sage]]. Todd May sees his oeuvre as trying to grapple with the question _how might one live?_ as opposed to the Socratic _how should one live?_ or Kant or Bentham's _how should one act?_

Deleuze belongs to the same generation as [[Derrida]] and [[Foucault]], but he works with an ontology. He wants to know what the forms and beings in life are. He wants to use philosophy to create concepts and disturb the nature of things. Concepts link together on a plane of immanence, palpating difference. Deleuze cares about _thought_ more than _knowledge_. 

## Apprenticeships

His work responds to mainstream Western philosophers, which the Sorbonne, his alma mater, emphasized through close readings, by challenging its fundamental notions. But he champions and harnesses minor (in the sense of undervaluation) philosophers and thinkers like [[Hume]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Spinoza]], Leibniz, and [[Bergson]] against Plato, [[Kant]], and Hegel. 

His big thinkers are Spinoza, Bergson, and Nietzsche. From Spinoza, he takes up [[Immanence]], rather than Transcendence. He is against Hegel and Kant wants to put the reversal of Platonism into motion. He takes up Expression rather than Emanation or Creation. Then, there is a univocity of being. Things fold, unfold, refold. 

From Bergson, he takes up temporality. 

- The present passes from present to past. 
- The present exists in actuality. 
- The past exists virtually. 
- The actualization of the past by a person is the psychological moment.
- The virtual past that is actualized is the ontological moment.

Substance is duration, the virtual that is there in all of its modes. 

From Nietzsche, he takes up the eternal return. (Deleuze likes becoming over being. He is a process philosopher.) The future is the eternal return, the return of difference. The future is virtual difference that has not yet actualized itself into a particular present. 

## Thought, Science, and Language

Abandon the dogmatic image of thought, which operates with common sense and good sense. Allow for immanence, duration, affirmation of difference.

"The coordination of common sense and good sense offers us a model of judgement as recognition. To judge is to recognize."

> Philosophy is left without means to realize its project of breaking with _doxa_. (Difference and Repetition)

How do we consider new possibilities? We have to think in terms of problems. "For the dogmatic image of thought, being is defined in terms of actuality rather than virtuality. It is a matter of stable identities rather than difference. To think ontologically in terms of stable identities is to read solutions back into problems, to approach problems in terms of solutions."

Science can think difference too, where it is a matter of understanding systems of difference in dynamic relation. Here, Deleuze looks to [[Simondon]]'s preindividual state. Biological individuals actualize a virtual intensive state. For example, the genes are a virtual field of intensities that actualize into specific concrete beings. This preindividual state is a multiplicity. The process is primary. Deleuze and Guattari also pick up on Jacques Monod's _Chance and Necessity_ which shows that some enzymes already have a self-ordering behavior. Or there's Prigogine and Stengers _Order Out of Chaos_, which looks at [[Emergence]]. They also look at [[Chaos]] in terms of bifurcations. This is Nietzsche's dice throw. 

For Deleuze in [[Logic of Sense]], a linguistic claim or proposition has three dimensions which require a fourth.

Denotation is the relation of the proposition to an external state of affairs. Manifestation concerns the relation of the proposition to the person who speaks and expresses himself. So we have the proposition, a speaker, and a set of affairs. But there's also signification, which has to do with implication of propositions. Logical demonstrations or material inference, keeping a promise, etc.

If that were it, we'd still be in the dogmatic image of thought. Deleuze wants to talk about the sense of the proposition. [[Stoicism]] discovered it along with the event. Sense is where language and the world meet. The boundary between propositions and things. The sense is the expressed of the proposition and the attribute of the state of affairs. When substance is expressed in its attributes and modes, it inheres in them. 

The event subsists in language, but happens to things by means of verbs in the infinitive form. 

 > Sense is the power of incorporeal transformation: whether I refer to the cut (actual) body as 'injured', 'scarred', or 'punished' will alter what it is in its incorporeal or virtual being. Sense is an event, producing new lines of becoming. -- Claire Colebrook
 
> To green, to be a stickup, is to orient bodies in certain ways, to create new lines of engagement among things, to cut a trajectory through the world, a trajectory in which both oneself and the world are affected. It is not a matter of representation but of an event that occurs both within and through language, at its point of intersection with the world.  -- Todd May

Sense is the concept that Deleuze substitutes for correspondence. But sense is paradoxical. "Language and the world are not simply a tidy match but rather a complex event, an event that only later gets honed by the dogmatic image of thought into something smooth." In addition, the paradox points to the proposition in which it subsists and the world of which it is an attribute. Language and the world are not symmetrical. The asymmetry between language and world points toward something deeper than sense, _nonsense._

This goes back to Saussurean linguistics, in which language depends on difference. So being is difference and language is a system of differences. "To speak, then, is to bring two series of differences into contact: being and language." Nonsense like in [[Carroll]] points to something essential about language. "It is only because there can be paradoxical elements that both bringing language and world together and keep them separate that there can be linguistic meaning at all." Sense is produced by nonsense; names are both signifying and signified. Deleuze says, "In short, sense is always an effect. Is it not an effect merely in the causal sense; it is also an effect in the sense of an 'optical effect' or a 'sound effect,' or, even better, a surface effect, a position effect, and a language effect." Sense is incorporeal, it is not inserted into the causal order of material things. To affirm language is to affirm becoming. It is to palpate that in language which is beyond representation.

Learning consists in abandoning bad habits, then conjugating our thoughts thoughts and our world, our thought and our language. 

## Difference

Deleuze is a philosopher of difference: he wants to displace being, identity, and the representational model of thought with difference and becoming, which is what his _magnum opus_ _Difference and Repetition_ (1968), a response to [[Heidegger]]'s _Being and Time_, does. 

We usually say that _A_ and _B_ are different when we perceive first that they belong to the same category, i.e. they are the same except for their differences. That tends to imply there is some underlying persistence in terms of categories and the objects that belong to them. Then, difference is seen through that lens. Is it possible to think about difference without relying on sameness?

It would mean thinking about each individual's becoming.

 
 Then, he collaborated with Felix Guattari. They wrote _Capitalism and Schizophrenia_ as well as [[What is Philosophy?]] together.
