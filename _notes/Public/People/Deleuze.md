Gilles Deleuze (1925-95) was a French [[Philosopher]]. In the first part of his career, he wrote books about classic philosophers, offering his own spin on their works. In particular, he seems to be drawn to [[Spinoza]], [[Nietzsche]], and Bergson but also [[Hume]]. Deleuze then created his own metaphysics in _Difference and Repetition_. Then, he collaborated with Felix Guattari. They wrote _[[What is Philosophy?]]_ together.


I've loosely been following [The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Deleuze](http://htmlgiant.com/random/the-beginners-guide-to-deleuze/) to learn more about him. 


* In _The Deleuze-Lucretius Encounter_, Ryan J. Johnson makes a connection between [[Deleuze]] and [[Lucretius]]. Johnson also wrote a book about Deleuze and [[Stoicism]]. 
* Deleuze and [[Foucault]] were connected.
* He had thoughts about [[Phenomenology]]
