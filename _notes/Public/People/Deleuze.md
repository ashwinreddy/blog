Gilles Deleuze (1925-95) was a French [[Philosopher]]. 

His work responds to mainstream Western philosophers, which the Sorbonne, his alma mater, emphasized through close readings, by challenging its fundamental notions. But he champions and harnesses minor (in the sense of undervaluation) philosophers and thinkers like [[Hume]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Spinoza]], Leibniz, and [[Bergson]] against Plato, [[Kant]], and Hegel. 

Deleuze is a philosopher of difference: he wants to displace being, identity, and the representational model of thought with difference and becoming, which is what his _magnum opus_ _Difference and Repetition_ (1968), a response to [[Heidegger]]'s _Being and Time_, does. 

We usually say that _A_ and _B_ are different when we perceive first that they belong to the same category, i.e. they are the same except for their differences. That tends to imply there is some underlying persistence in terms of categories and the objects that belong to them. Then, difference is seen through that lens. Is it possible to think about difference without relying on sameness?

It would mean thinking about each individual's becoming.

 
 Then, he collaborated with Felix Guattari. They wrote _Capitalism and Schizophrenia_ as well as [[What is Philosophy?]] together.
