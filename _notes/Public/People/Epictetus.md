Epictetus was a [[Stoic]]. 

> If a philosopher's words fail to produce \[the realization that the listener is in a bad way], they're lifeless and the speaker's a corpse too. (_Discourses_ 3.23.8)

Cf. [[Gilles Deleuze]]

> The use of philosophy is to sadden. A philosophy that saddes no one, that annoys no one, is not a philosophy. It is useful for harming stupidity, for turning stupidity into something shameful.
