Michel Foucault was a philosopher from [[France]] who used the technique [[Genealogy]]. In [[Technologies of the Self]], he says 

> My objective for more than twenty-five years has been to sketch out a history of the different ways in our culture that humans develop knowledge about themselves: economics, biology, psychiatry, medicine, and penology. The main point is not to accept this knowledge at face value but to analyze these so-called sciences as very specific "truth [[game]]s" related to specific techniques that human beings use to understand themselves. 


Foucault wrote an intro to a book by [[Deleuze]] and books about [[Sex]]. His influences include [[Heidegger]] and [[Nietzsche]] and [[Marx]].
