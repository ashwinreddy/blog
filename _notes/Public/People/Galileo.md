Galileo (1564-1642) was an Italian scientist. Milton called him "the Tuscan Artist."


Talking about natural philosophy in terms of [[Mathematics]] and that without it, science is a [[Labyrinth]].

>Philosophy is written in that great book which ever is before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. The book is written in mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.
