Gilles Deleuze (18 January 1925 - 95) was a French philosopher and, to me, the philosopher's philosopher and a [[Sage]]. His work grapples with Difference, [[Creativity]], [[Thought]], and Becoming and references a diverse set of works. 

## Influences & Philosophical Lineage

In the introduction to _Deleuze's Philosophical Lineage_, Graham Jones and Jon Roffe make some important points about why it's hard to read Deleuze.

His work is richly detailed and complex. There are lots of concepts that he assumes you know. If you turn to commentary, Deleuze Studies has created its own Image of Deleuzian Thought because of overdue translations in a non-chronological order and accepting at face value Deleuze's own personal utterances. In some cases, people pick and choose pieces of his work without considering the whole by citing the 'rhizome' and 'nomad.' Or one might make [[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]] the essence or summit of his project and interpret too literally machinic desire in [[Anti-Oedipus]]. Or there are those who grant too much significance to [[Nietzsche]] and [[Spinoza]], which, although Deleuze validated, doesn't take into account his whole oeuvre.

Instead, Deleuze's thought unfolds internal to an examination of the thought of others. Deleuze's method is one of reading. "His reading practice is clearly one of close, attentive excavation, a careful sieving of the conceptual top-soil in search of latent or even nascent elements beneath." "Deleuze's strategy is more geared towards conceptual and functional differentiation, exploring the horizon of Ideas (in the Kantian sense) and bringing forth the machinic and operative features of the philosophies with which he engages." He teases out the thought they never intended but are there nonetheless, e.g. extracting structure in [[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]. He finds implicit structure in other's work that then resonates with his own. His work is like a history of philosophy in itself. 

## Apprenticeships

His work responds to mainstream Western philosophers, which the Sorbonne, his alma mater, emphasized through close readings, by challenging their fundamental notions. The Great Oral Exam included a French, Greek, and Latin text. But he champions and harnesses minor (in the sense of undervaluation) philosophers. 

His big thinkers are Spinoza, Bergson, and Nietzsche. From Spinoza, he takes up [[Immanence]], rather than Transcendence. He is against Hegel and Kant wants to put the reversal of Platonism into motion. He takes up Expression rather than Emanation or Creation. Then, there is a univocity of being. Things fold, unfold, refold. 

From Bergson, he takes up temporality. 

- The present passes from present to past. 
- The present exists in actuality. 
- The past exists virtually. 
- The actualization of the past by a person is the psychological moment.
- The virtual past that is actualized is the ontological moment.

Substance is duration, the virtual that is there in all of its modes. 

From Nietzsche, he takes up the eternal return. (Deleuze likes becoming over being. He is a process philosopher.) The future is the eternal return, the return of difference. The future is virtual difference that has not yet actualized itself into a particular present. 

## Thought, Science, and Language

Abandon the dogmatic image of thought, which operates with common sense and good sense. Allow for immanence, duration, affirmation of difference.

"The coordination of common sense and good sense offers us a model of judgement as recognition. To judge is to recognize."

> Philosophy is left without means to realize its project of breaking with _doxa_. ([[Difference and Repetition]])

How do we consider new possibilities? We have to think in terms of problems. "For the dogmatic image of thought, being is defined in terms of actuality rather than virtuality. It is a matter of stable identities rather than difference. To think ontologically in terms of stable identities is to read solutions back into problems, to approach problems in terms of solutions."

Science can think difference too, where it is a matter of understanding systems of difference in dynamic relation. Here, Deleuze looks to Simondon's preindividual state. Biological individuals actualize a virtual intensive state. For example, the genes are a virtual field of intensities that actualize into specific concrete beings. This preindividual state is a multiplicity. The process is primary. Deleuze and Guattari also pick up on Jacques Monod's _Chance and Necessity_ which shows that some enzymes already have a self-ordering behavior. Or there's Prigogine and Stengers _Order Out of Chaos_, which looks at Emergence. They also look at chaos in terms of bifurcations. This is Nietzsche's dice throw.

## Biography

Deleuze was born in Paris to a middle-class family. 

Deleuze's older brother George was a big influence on him. Georges Deleuze joined the Resistance but died en route to a concentration camp after being caught, making him a hero while Gilles was neglected to some extent. At 15, Gilles was sent to boarding school in Brittany. His literature professor Pierre Halbwachs introduced him to literature, and he couldn't get enough. He was introduced to philosophy by his friend Michel Tournier and a philosophy class in his last year of high school. He was excited by [[Sartre]]'s _Being and Nothingness_, which he read in a week. He and Tournier were upset by his lecture "Existentialism Is a Humanism." As early as 1947, he saw [[Bergson]] as a great philosopher.

Deleuze thinks of himself as a classic philosopher and works with ontology. He wants to know what the forms and beings in life are. He wants to use philosophy to create [[concept]]s and disturb the nature of things. Concepts link together on a plane of immanence, palpating difference. Deleuze cares about _thought_ more than _knowledge_.


He took his own life at the age of 70. He had a pulmonary ailment and had lost a lung. 

## Misc

- Deleuze thinks about philosophy as happening in [[Writing]] (?) It definitely does not happen in communication or dialectic. 
- He thinks of himself as working in the line of [[Empiricism]].

I get the sense that Deleuze would have liked aspects of [[Metamorphoses]] and the work of [[Nabokov]].
