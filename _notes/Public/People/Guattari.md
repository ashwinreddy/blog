FÃ©lix Guattari (1930-1992) was a collaborator of [[Gilles Deleuze]], former disciple of [[Lacan]]. For a while, he stayed with his grandmother, where he witnessed his step-grandfather's death, which gave him anxiety for a long time. He engaged in gangs as a teenager. When he was 15, he started attending Communist Party meetings. His girlfriend was Micheline Kao, whom he lived with for a bit. His parents feared the Kaos would steal him away. Guattari was influenced by [[Sartre]] enough to comment about him in his diary, and he never repudiated that taste.
