georg wilhelm friedrich hegel (1770-1831) was a german philosopher. he was influenced by [[kant]]. 

unlike kant, he sees no reason to talk about the thing-in-itself. So whatever is real is rational. We can understand the progression of [[history]] as a logical [[dialectic]]. hegel himself isn't the one who uses the thesis-antithesis-synthesis vocabulary (apparently, that's [[fichte]] and [[schelling]]), but that's the high-level idea. 

one could put him in with [[mysticism]] (?)

the [[french revolution]] is an important event for him. 

hegel says the subject matter of religion is "god and nothing but god," even for [[buddhism]] where he says "nothing" is the supreme. But he uses substance, essence, God, etc. to talk about Buddhism when it is incompatible with those concepts (this comes from Byung Chul-Han).
