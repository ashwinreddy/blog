David Hume was a [[Philosopher]] who broadly took a skeptic attitude. He was interested in empiricism, subjectivity, experience and [[Causality]], and [[Ethics]]. 

* He doesn't believe in causality. 
* He doesn't believe in substance. 



_Observation_: There are some affinities between Hume and [[Spinoza]].
