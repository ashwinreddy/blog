Kant was an influential German philosopher. He was inspired by [[Hume]]. He wrote _Critique of Pure Reason_, _Critique of Practical Reason_. 

For Kant, there is a realm of _phenomena_ or apperances and then a _noumenal_ realm behind it, beyond space and time. They are bridged by judgement and even aesthetic play.
