Napoleon was the French emperor after the [[French Revolution]]. He was influenced by [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Alexander the Great]]. There's an interesting question to be asked about his connection to the [[Enlightenment]]. [Apparently](https://shannonselin.com/2015/02/napoleon-like-read/ ), he liked to read [[Plutarch]] and [[Goethe]] and [[Homer]], etc.
