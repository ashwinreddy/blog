Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900) was a German philosopher. In 1869, at the age of 24, he became a professor. His first book was _The Birth of Tragedy_, published in 1872, about Greek tragedies. In _Beyond Good and Evil_ (1886), Nietzsche points out that philosophers have assumed an equality between Truth and the Good. He developed a kind of proto-[[Existentialism]] [[Process philosophy]]. 

[[Deleuze]] sees Nietzsche's project as introducing sense and value into philosophy.
