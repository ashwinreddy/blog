Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900) was a philosopher from Germany. In 1869, at the age of 24, he became a professor. His first book was _The Birth of Tragedy_, published in 1872, about Greek tragedies. In _Beyond Good and Evil_ (1886), Nietzsche points out that philosophers have assumed an equality between Truth and the Good. He developed a kind of proto-[[Existentialism]] [[Process philosophy]] attacking [[Christianity]]. 

[[Deleuze]] sees Nietzsche's project as introducing sense and value into philosophy. Nietzsche sees himself as the "first tragic philosopher" and tries to go back to pre-Socratics like Heraclitus. He is opposed to decadence and _ressentiment_. 

In _On the Genealogy of Morality_ and _The Will to Power_, Nietzsche develops the idea of active and reactive forces. 

Nietzsche sees [[Play]] as cosmic.

He was (somewhat unfairly) connected to Nazism. 

He said [[God]] is dead. 

Nietzsche was planning to write a book called Homer's Contest  (_Homers Wettkampf_)
