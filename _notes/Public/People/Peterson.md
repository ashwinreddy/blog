Jordan Peterson (1962-) is a Professor of [[Psychology]] from [[Canada]]. Although I have found his ideas intellectually interesting, I have come to the soft conclusion that he is a [[Sophist]], that he dresses them up in rhetoric and that there are other thinkers who can say the important things he has to say better than he can.

Peterson's mother is a librarian, and he studied in a great books program (source needed). A majority of Peterson's philosophy comes straight out of the [[Literature]] and [[Philosophy]] of the [[Western canon]], which he recommends to people. For example, he often cites or talks about the [[Bible]], which he has lectured on, in many of his discussions. His thought more generally is rooted in [[Christianity]]. He likes to use examples like [[Paradise Lost]] or [[Dostoevsky]]. Naturally, the fact that he's so entrenched in this mode of thought draws him into problems in the criticism of [[Literature]].

As a result, he attacks Relativism and Postmodernism (which he also associates with [[Marxism]]), especially [[Foucault]] and [[Derrida]], whom he doesn't seem to have read. 

In psychology, Peterson has studied alcohol abuse, [[Personality]], and [[Myth]]. His influces include [[Freud]], [[Jung]], [[Nietzsche]]. He talks about the [[Oedipus complex]] a lot. 

One of the questions that drives Peterson is how [[Ideology]] led to [[Fascism]] (i.e. [[Nazism]] in [[Germany]]) and [[Communism]] in [[Russia]]. 

He is also interested in responses to relativism, [[Nihilism]], and [[Existentialism]]. 

Peterson's philosophy is roughly inside [[Pragmatism]], [[Phenomenology]], [[Individualism]]. Although he uses [[Science]] (he likes arguments from [[Evolution]]), he says we don't always act like it's true. We need narratives to guide us. He thinks everybody has [[God]] as the top of their value of hierarchies. 

Peterson believes [[Capitalism]] is the only economic solution that works because the [[Pareto distribution]] is common in nature. 

Peterson has engaged in dialogues with [[Zizek]] and [[Vervaeke]]. 

Also, he relies on the argument of [[Dreyfus]] that computers can't see the world.
