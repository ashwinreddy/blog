Plato was a philosopher from Athens, a disciple of [[Socrates]]. 

Following [Sadler's advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X72ELQFnjYU). 

## [[Gilles Deleuze]]

As mentioned in _Deleuze's Philosophical Lineage_, Deleuze says in [[Difference and Repetition]] and the first appendix of [[Logic of Sense]] the task of philosophy is the _renversement_ of [[Platonism]], which created an image of thought, a transcendent representation of Idea at the cost of difference in itself. But it is here, where he has made Plato an enemy, that Deleuze will also make him his ally.
