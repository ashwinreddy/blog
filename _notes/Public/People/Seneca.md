|_Non est philosophia populare artificium nec ostentationi paratum. Non in verbis, sed in rebus est. Nec in hoc adhibetur, ut cum aliqua oblectatione consumatur dies, ut dematur otio nausia. Animum format et fabricat, vitam disponit, actiones regit, agenda et omittenda demonstrat, sedet ad gubernaculum et per ancipitia fluctuantium derigit cursum. Sine hac nemo intrepide potest vivere, nemo secure. Innumerabilia accidunt singulis horis, quae consilium exigant, quod ab hac petendum est._|Philosophy is not a popular trick nor equipment for showing off. It exists not in words but in deeds. And it is not put to use in this, so that the day is consumed with some delight, so that nausia surrenders to leisure. It forms and constructs the mind, lays down life, rules actions, shows what is to be done and what is to be left out, it sits at the helm and directs the course through the uncertainties of hesitating. Without it, nobody can live without fear, nobody untroubled. Countless things happen each hour that call for help, which must be sought from philosophy. |
