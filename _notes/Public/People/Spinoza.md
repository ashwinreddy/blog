Baruch[^names] Spinoza was a [[Philosopher]] and, in my mind, a [[Sage]] who lived from 1632 to 1677. Because he didn't believe in the traditional religion of his time, he was cast out of Amsterdam's Jewish community in 1656. 

* Spinoza's thinking was clearly influenced by [[Descartes]]. 
* Spinoza wrote two big philosophical works: the _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_ and  [[Spinoza's Ethics]].

[^names]: From Nader's _Think Least Of Death_: "Bento was his given name in the Portuguese-Jewish community of Amsterdam. Baruch was the Hebrew name used in the synagogue, and Benedictus is the Latin version of his name that appears in his published writings. All three names mean 'blessed.'"
