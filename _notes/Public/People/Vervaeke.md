John Vervaeke is a professor of cognitive science at University of Toronto in Canada with a deep background in [[Philosophy]]. Vervaeke has developed a theory called Relevance Realization, which is explained in his excellent lecture series on YouTube called [Awakening from the Meaning Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ). 

His interest started in the connection between Buddhism and Cognitive Science, especially in terms of [[Mindfulness]]. He associates this with increasing interest in [[Wisdom]], psychedelics, [[Stoic]], and [[Meaningness]]. He wants to provide the [[Explanation]] for this. He thinks there is a Meaning Crisis, associated with Environmental Crisis and Socio-Economic Crisis. 

Vervaeke thinks of himself as part of a tradition of [[Zen]] [[Neoplatonism]]. For that reason, key figures for him are [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Buddha]], and the [[Kyoto School]]. But he is also deeply influenced by [[Spinoza]]. 

He comes from a background in fundamentalist [[Christianity]].
