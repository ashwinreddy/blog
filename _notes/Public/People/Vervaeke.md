John Vervaeke is a professor of cognitive science at University of Toronto in Canada. He has done extensive work in philosophy. Vervaeke's main theory is called Relevance Realization, which is explained in his excellent lecture series on YouTube called [Awakening from the Meaning Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ). 

His interest started in the connection between Buddhism and Cognitive Science, especially in terms of [[Mindfulness]]. He associates this with increasing interest in [[Wisdom]], psychedelics, [[Stoicism]], and [[Meaningness]]. He wants to provide the [[Explanation]] for this. He thinks there is a Meaning Crisis, associated with Environmental Crisis and Socio-Economic Crisis.
