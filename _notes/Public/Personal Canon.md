A personal canon is a list of books that captures ideas worth thinking about. For example, in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgT1A5KqCik) Salman Rushdie talks about his canon. 

The list is [here](https://bookshelf.website/ashwinreddy). But I also have two essays to mention.

> A mistake to think of the humanities as luxuries or as a decent appearance that must be kept up, like the country club membership or the house in Palm Beach. Necessities. I can think of no other set of studies more relevant to our present circumstance. Our technologists bear comparison to the sorcererâ€™s apprentice, producing continuously improved means toward increasingly ill-defined ends. Unless we look to the humanities to clean up the mess, we stand a better than even chance of killing ourselves with our new toys.
