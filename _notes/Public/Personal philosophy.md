I want to know how to be a good [[Human]] being. I don't think there are any definitive answers, it's always a work in progress. Nietzsche reminds us that [[Philosopher]]s usually build out philosophies based on their personal values, so what I say here reflects me alone. 


Part of that is finding [[Meaningness]], which usually involves finding an [[Activity]] that can keep us engaged. The job of an [[Education]] is, and I don't mean this reductively, about learning to play with [[Sprachspiel]]e.
