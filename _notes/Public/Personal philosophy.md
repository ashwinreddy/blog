> What I propose, therefore, is very simple: it is nothing more than to think what we are doing. -- [[Arendt]]

Obviously a great deal of this [[Digital Garden]] is dedicated to discovering my own [[Philosophy]] through a [[Personal Canon]] and by following my [[Personal Heroes]]. But maybe it's worth describing the major components here.

The story begins with the threat of [[Nihilism]] and [[Absurdism]], which empty out [[Meaningness]]. We set off on a journey to find it. The tools in reach are [[Classic book]]s in [[Philosophy]] and [[Literature]]. 

We see that [[Myth]] takes us as far back as pre-history. The eternal story is of the [[Hero's Journey]], of grappling with [[Chaos]]. We see that humans have always been [[Technologist]]s, creating [[Technology]]. In the modern world, we feel closer to [[Machine]]. And we understand the world through mechanistic [[Causality]]. So we see all sorts of towering systems, and we have such little [[Agency]].

We realize that [[Meaningness]] is an example of [[Emergence]] in [[Game]]-playing and [[Language]]. In fact, I think we can say meaning is a fundamental characteristic of [[Sprachspiel]]. One modality for meaning comes from [[Literature]], [[Myth]], and [[Art]]. In these things, we have to recover [[Playfulness]].
