Philosophy happens when friends of wisdom ([[Socrates]]) discuss ([[Rorty]]) and create concepts ([[Deleuze]]) with which to direct their lives ([[Seneca]]) and dispel misconceptions that hinder them ([[Wittgenstein]]). Philosophers are not necessarily [[Sage]]s, but they are at least friends of the sage.

## Resources

Getting into philosophy is rewarding but difficult. Here are my recommendations for beginners.

1. Start with what's interesting. For me, that was [[Stoic]] and Marcus Aurelius. 
2. Good general background resources are the podcast [Philosophize This](https://www.philosophizethis.org/) and Will Durant's _Story of Philosophy_, which goes through about a dozen big names in the western canon of philosophy.
3. Reading philosophy is a hard skill, but Ellie Anderson has [good advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pj26s8u6Vo) about how to develop it. (Her whole channel is great.)
4. I'm planning to follow [Susan Rigetti's guide](https://www.susanrigetti.com/philosophy) to flesh out my understanding.
