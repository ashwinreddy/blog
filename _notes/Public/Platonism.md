Platonism starts with the theory of [[Plato]]'s forms. You ask the question _what is X?_

- _eidos_ - "visible form"
- _morphe_ - "shape"
- _phainomena_ - "appearances"

## Reversal

[[Deleuze]] works on the _renversement_ of Platonism, which imposes a transcendent representation of Idea -- an image of thought -- at the cost of difference in itself. Wasn't the abolition of essences attempted by [[Kant]] and [[Hegel]]? Yes, but we want to dismantle Platonism from the inside. Don't overturn it, overcome it. Produce the simulacrum of Platonism using Platonism. 

[[Aristotle]] wants to differentiate the genus into a species with differentiation. Plato doesn't do this, not because he's less developed, but actually because he's leaving a space open.
