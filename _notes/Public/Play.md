Play is a difficult concept to get a grip on. Randolph Feezell has a [paper](https://philpapers.org/rec/FEEAPC) arguing for a pluralistic conception of play as

* behavior or activity,
* motive, attitude, or state of mind,
* form or structure
* meaningful experience
* ontologically distinctive phenomenon

I like to think play is, as Brian Upton says, free movement within a [[System]] of constraints.

A [[game]] is the clearest instantiation of play, one that can be analyzed and understood more rationally. Thinkers of play (and games) include

* Huizinga, who wrote _Homo ludens_ (1938)
* Roger Caillois, who wrote _Man, Play and Games_ (1958). He used the taxonomy of _agon_, _alea_, _mimicry_, _ilinx_. He points out that play is free and not obligatory, separate from the real world, governed by rules, with outcomes uncertain in advance. 
* [[Kant]], propagated into literature by Romantics like Coleridge
* [[Schiller]]
* Gadamer
* [[Nietzsche]] -- the _kosmos_ is in aesthetic play. _The Birth of Tragedy_, _Thus Spake Zarathustra_. 
* Oscar Wilde
* Herbert Spencer in _Principles of Psychology_
* [[Wittgenstein]]
* Vladimir [[Nabokov]]
* Lewis [[Carroll]]
