Pragmatism is an American school of philosophical thought led by William James and C.S. Peirce that focuses on the practical difference that philosophy makes. It orients itself toward whatever the user of philosophy wants to do. If they want to do science, for example, then pragmatism tells them to develop operational definitions.
