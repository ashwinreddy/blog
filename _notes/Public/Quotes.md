> Very few great scientists have written interestingly, and these few have usually felt apologetic about it. Yet sooner or later the time will come when the mighty sweep of modern scientific discovery will be placed, by scientific men with the gift of expression, at the service of intelligent and cultivated laymen. Another writer of "Canterbury Tales," another singer of "Paradise Lost," could not add more to the sum of literary achievement than the man who may picture to us the phases of the age-long history of life on this globe, or make vivid before our eyes the tremendous march of the worlds through space. -- Theodore Roosevelt, History as Literature

> What I propose, therefore, is very simple: it is nothing more than to think what we are doing. -- [[Arendt]]

> There is hope in the thought, and hope is much needed, under the dark clouds which lower above the horizon. -- Frederick Douglass.

> If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the _atomic hypothesis_ (or the atomic _fact_, or whatever you wish to call it) that _all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another_. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an _enormous_ amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.
