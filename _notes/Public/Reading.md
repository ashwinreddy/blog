Reading is the [[Activity]] of decoding symbols to understand their meaning. Reading is a good activity and habit to get into. 

I generally like to [start many books and finish few of them](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/how-to-read-lots-of-inputs-and-a-strong-filter/). I also generally try to read older books. 

In _[How to Read a Book](https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-to-read-a-book-the-art-of-getting-a-liberal-education/oclc/315673274&referer=brief_results)_, Mortimer Adler gives a helpful guide on reading. For example, he gives 4 questions to ask of a [[Book]]. 

1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail, and how?
3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
4. What of it?
