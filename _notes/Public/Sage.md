A sage is a wise [[Human]], someone with an appropriate [[Stance]] toward [[Meaningness]] and [[Chaos]]. In [[Literature]], the sage often appears in the archetypal story [[The Prince Returns]]. In Platonic and Hellenistic thought (e.g. [[Stoicism]]), there is also a particular sense for what the sage is like.
