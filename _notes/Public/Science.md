Science generates [[Knowledge]] and [[Explanation]]s about the world through empirical experiments. Science depends on some sense of [[Causality]]. 



There is a theoretical view of science and a practical one. In _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_, Thomas Kuhn points out that paradigm shifts don't occur within the scientific framework itself. In _Against Method_, Paul Feyerabend says science doesn't really have a method. Science can also occur bottom-up as pointed out in _A People's History of Science_.
