Science generates [[Knowledge]] and [[Explanation]]s about the world through empirical experiments. 

> Now I'm going to discuss how we would look for a new law. In general, we look for a new law by the following process: First, we guess it. (Laughter). Well, don't laugh, that's really true. Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what, if this is right, if this law that we guessed is right, we see what it would imply. And then we compare those computation results to nature, or we say compare to experiment or experience. Compare it directly to observation to see if it works. If it disagrees with experiment, it's wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn't make a difference how beautiful your guess is, it doesn't make it even about how smart you are who made the guess or what his name is, if it disagrees with experiment, it's wrong. That's all there is to it.  â€“ Richard  Feynman.

There is a theoretical view of science and a practical one. In _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_, Thomas Kuhn points out that paradigm shifts don't occur within the scientific framework itself. In _Against Method_, Paul Feyerabend says science doesn't really have a method. Science can also occur bottom-up as pointed out in _A People's History of Science_.
