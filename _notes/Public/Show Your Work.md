Show Your Work! It's not just a command from your math teachers. In his [book](https://www.worldcat.org/title/show-your-work-10-ways-to-share-your-creativity-and-get-discovered/oclc/915583015?referer=di&ht=edition) of the same name, Austin Kleon describes why and how.

* see what might be interesting to think about next.
* correct your reasoning if you or others find a bug.
