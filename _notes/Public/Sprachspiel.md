_Sprachspiel_ is a concept of a [[Language]]-[[Game]] used by [[Wittgenstein]]. Early in his work, Wittgenstein argued that language was about [[Meaningness]]. But Sprachspiel is a concept that looks at how language is used. It is a rather flexible and open concept, so we begin with examples Wittgenstein himself used.
