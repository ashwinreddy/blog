A Stoic follows the precepts of Stoicism, a [[Hellenistic philosophy]] whose name comes from Greek _stoa_, or porch, because the members would gather there at the central square of Athens to discuss. The English word 'stoic' has come to mean somebody cold and unfeeling, associated with the stiff upper lip of Victorian aristocrats. This is far from its original meaning.

## Principles

 In [The Practicing Stoic](https://www.worldcat.org/title/practicing-stoic-a-philosophical-users-manual/oclc/994583179), Ward Farnsworth nicely summarizes the [[Activity]] of practicing Stoicism. 

> The first principle of practical Stoicism is this: we don't react to events; we react to our judgements about them, and the judgements are up to us.

Or, in the words of prince [[Hamlet]], 

> There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so
 
The Stoic goal is to get clear about our judgements so that they do not push us around. For that matter, Stoicism urges to determine what lies within our control and what without.[^enchiridion] The outside is external, and we ought not to be attached to such things.


[^enchiridion]: From the first sentence of Epictetus' _Enchiridion_ (Handbook).

## Philosophy

The [[Philosophy]] of Stoicism imagines that the world is rational, organized by the logos.
