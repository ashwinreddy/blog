Stoicism is one of the Hellenistic schools of philosophy, which means it emerges after and borrows from Socratic / Platonic thought. The name comes from Greek _stoa_, or porch, because the members would gather there to discuss the ideas.

Ward Farnsworth systematically presents the principles of Stoicism in [The Practicing Stoic](https://www.worldcat.org/title/practicing-stoic-a-philosophical-users-manual/oclc/994583179).

> The first principle of practical Stoicism is this: we don't react to events; we react to our judgements about them, and the judgements are up to us.
