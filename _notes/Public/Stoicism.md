Stoicism is one of the Hellenistic schools of philosophy, which means it emerges after and borrows from Socratic / Platonic thought. The name comes from Greek _stoa_, or porch, because the members would gather there to discuss the ideas.

The English word 'stoic' has come to mean somebody cold and unfeeling, associated with the stiff upper lip of Victorian aristocrats. This is far from its original meaning.

Ward Farnsworth systematically presents the principles of Stoicism in [The Practicing Stoic](https://www.worldcat.org/title/practicing-stoic-a-philosophical-users-manual/oclc/994583179). 

## Principles

1. Some things are in our control and others not.[^enchiridion]
2. Our judgements and opinions of things are in our control. 
3. There are Stoic [[Technologies of the Self]]. 
4. Virtue is all one needs.

[^enchiridion]: From the first sentence of Epictetus' _Enchiridion_ (Handbook).
