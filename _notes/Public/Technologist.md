> A technologist makes reason out of the messiness of the world, leverages their understanding to envision a different reality, and builds a pathway to make their vision happen.[^definition]

[^definition]: From [To be a Technologist is to be Human](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/To-be-a-Technologist-is-to-be-Human):

A technologist tries to solve [[Problem]] by understanding (and tweaking or creating) the [[Machine]]. 

We create [[Abstraction]]s to manage [[Information]] and [[Meaningness]] such as in [[Art]], [[Philosophy]], [[Science]], [[Language]], and [[Game]]s. We engage in [[Cooperation]].  Yet each of us has an individual personality that we use to contribute to the larger project of being human. We do this in a self-reinforcing fashion, through education.
