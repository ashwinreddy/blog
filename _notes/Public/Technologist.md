From [To be a Technologist is to be Human](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/To-be-a-Technologist-is-to-be-Human):

> A technologist makes reason out of the messiness of the world, leverages their understanding to envision a different reality, and builds a pathway to make their vision happen.

Does this not mean a technologist is just a player of [[Game]]?
