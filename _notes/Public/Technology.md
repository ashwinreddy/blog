Technology is a response to _[[Chaos]] sive Natura_. 

In _Die Frage nach der Technik_, [[Heidegger]] asks what technology is. The starting answer is that it is a means to an end and a [[human]] activity, because that's what positing ends and procuring and utilizing their means is. The core question is about instrumentality and within what do such things as means and ends belong. The answer is causality. 

Heidegger will appeal to [[Explanation#Aristotelian Theory]]. TODO
