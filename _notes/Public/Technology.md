> All life is problem solving. All organisms are inventors and technicians, good or not so good, successful or not so successful, in solving technical problems. This is how it is among animals - spiders, for example. Human technology solves human problems such as sewage disposal, or the storage and supply of food and water, as, for example, bees already have to do. -- [[Popper]]

Technology is an organism's response to _[[Chaos]] sive Natura_ in the form of a "low-resistance path to an end."[^what-is-technology]

In _Die Frage nach der Technik_, [[Heidegger]] asks what technology is. The starting answer is that it is a means to an end and a [[human]] activity, because that's what positing ends and procuring and utilizing their means is. The core question is about instrumentality and within what do such things as means and ends belong. The answer is causality. Heidegger will appeal to Aristotle's theory of causation.

[[Nabokov]] agrees with Heidegger here. Completing the prompt "the great tragedy of modern art," he responds that "an artist cannot look at an airplane and see anything but a plane."
