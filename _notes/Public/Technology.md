I take technology (from Greek _techne_ for craft and _logos_ for system of thought) to be any recurring, productive response to [[Chaos]] from a living being. This definition is broader than most people mean in everyday speech, but Michel Foucault's "Technologies of the Self" describes [[Stoicism]], for example, as a technology. In that work, Foucault outlines 4 major types of technologies.

|Type|Ability|
|----|-------|
|Production|Produce, transform, manipulate things|
|Sign systems|Use signs, meanings, symbols, or signification|
|Power|Turn other individuals into objects for some end|
|Self|Let individuals effect their own means or transform themselves|

I believe art, science, and philosophy are technologies on all 4 counts.
