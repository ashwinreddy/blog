> Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world. -- Archimedes

Technology literally means system (_logos_) of craft (_techne_). It is a reusable response to [[Chaos]] from a living being, thereby extending the body.[^inspiration] 

[^inspiration]: This definition is greatly inspired by the essay [What is Technology?](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/What-is-Technology),  in which "technology is a reusable, low-resistance path to achieve some end or goal." 

Technology is biologically grounded, though it need not be suffused with intentionality: people don't always create technology with an end in mind. Whether organisms are aware of it or not, evolution gives them technologies with which to survive. But a [[Human]] is a [[Technologist]], an agent specifically adapted to creating new technologies. For our intents and purposes, then, technology is also socially grounded. 




This observation ought to broaden what we consider technology. Michel Foucault gives us this bigger picture in [[Technologies of the Self]].
