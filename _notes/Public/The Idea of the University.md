_The Idea of the University_ is a book by Karl Jaspers.

- The university is a community of scholars and students engaged in the task of seeking truth.
- Its autonomy comes from academic freedom. People should be allowed to seek truth.
- But there's also a public (political/social) side. People need scientific ability and intellectual training.
- The university is the corporate realization of man's determination to know.
