A digital garden is a digital space that we cultivate. Digital gardens are similar to Wikis and [Zettelkastens](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/). I prefer the term _digital garden_ because an encyclopedia aims to be comprehensive and the term Zettelkasten is outdated because we're not using slip boxes. Plus, the garden [[Metaphor]] is vivid and lovely. There's a nice [article by Tech Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) about digital gardens.

The basic unit of a digital garden is an evergreen note. The principles are simple.
* We update our notes as our thinking evolves.
* One note is one unit of knowledge work, based around a concept or big idea. 
* Notes link to each other.

Maggie Appleton has a clear overview [here](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens), and Andy Matuschak's [notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) are a great example.
