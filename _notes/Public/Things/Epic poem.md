An epic poem is a work of narrative [[Poet]]ry of great length about extraordinary or larger-than-life characters, especially involving [[Hero's Journey]] or [[God]]. In [A preface to Paradise Lost](https://www.worldcat.org/title/preface-to-paradise-lost/oclc/1269090815&referer=brief_results), C.S. Lewis categorizes _Paradise Lost_ as a secondary epic, in the sense that it is a literary production rather than an oral tradition.

The epic poem is primarily a form for high [[Literature]] and many an epic poem have become [[Classic book]]s.
