An epic poem is a narrative poem of great length about extraordinary or larger-than-life characters. In [A preface to Paradise Lost](https://www.worldcat.org/title/preface-to-paradise-lost/oclc/1269090815&referer=brief_results), C.S. Lewis categorizes _Paradise Lost_ as a secondary epic, in the sense that it is a literary production rather than an oral tradition.

The epic poem is primarily a form for great [[Literature]].
