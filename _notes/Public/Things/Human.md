> Perhaps the big question isn't _what is the meaning of my life_ or _who am I_ but _what does it mean to be a human being? What is the experience, or the [[Essence]], the condition of humans?_


A human is a member of _Homo sapiens_. First, a human is a special [[Animal]], _animal laborans_, a toiling animal. We must face our biological reality. There is necessary [[Activity]] in finding [[Food]],  in [[Sleep]]ing. 

But surviving is not enough. We are not [[Machine]]. Yes, we seek to endure, but we seek it to thrive, to flourish. That is the [[Hero's Journey]]. A human can develop into at least three things: _Homo faber_, _Homo sapiens_, _Homo ludens_. The creator, the sage, the player. Daedalus, Socrates, Odysseus. 

A human is a [[Technologist]] embodied as a variant of a chimpanzee. In that sense, the human species is uniquely capable of responding to [[Chaos]]. That is, we have [[Agency]]. Instead of wings or claws, we have [[Intelligence]]; we use it to develop [[Technology]] that extends our body in place of such adaptations. We know how to create an [[Abstraction]] to manage [[Information]] and [[Meaningness]] such as in [[Art]], [[Language]], and [[Game]]s. We organize ourselves socially with concepts like [[Free Will]] and [[Causality]] and [[Justice]]. We engage in [[Cooperation]].  Yet each of us has an individual personality that we use to contribute to the larger project of being human. We do this in a self-reinforcing fashion, through [[Education]]. Once in a while, one of us becomes a [[Sage]] and tells us something important.

My understanding of what a human is has been greatly informed by my [[Personal Canon]].
