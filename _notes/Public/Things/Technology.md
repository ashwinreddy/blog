Technology[^footnote] is a reusable response to [[Chaos]] from a living being. 

[^footnote]: Comes from Greek _techne_ for craft + _logos_ for system of thought. 

This definition is greatly inspired by the essay [What is Technology?](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/What-is-Technology),  in which "technology is a reusable, low-resistance path to achieve some end or goal." 

I mention living beings to highlight that technology does not emerge from nowhere. It is biologically grounded. Evolution has given different organisms different technologies with which to survive. For humans specifically, technology always has a social history and social uses. This observation should broaden the scope of things we consider technology. Michel Foucault gives us this bigger picture when he describes 4 major types of technologies in [[Technologies of the Self]].

|Type|Ability|Example|
|----|-------|---------|
|Production|Produce, transform, manipulate things||
|Sign systems|Use signs, meanings, symbols, or signification||
|Power|Turn other individuals into objects for some end||
|Self|Let individuals effect their own means or transform themselves|[[Stoicism]]|

It's important not to overemphasize intentionality here. When people are creating a technology, it is not always entirely clear what type of technology it is or what end they seek. For example, the internet has dramatically morphed since its inception. 

That's why I describe technology as a response to chaos. If a hobbyist connects their electric guitar to some homemade software on their laptop for a jam sesh, that is better characterized as staving off chaos than achieving some particular goal.

Technology is powerful because it extends the human body. This is nothing more than what Archimedes said: give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world.

Someone who uses technology is a [[Technologist]].
