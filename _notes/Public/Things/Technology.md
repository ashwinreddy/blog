> Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world. -- Archimedes

Technology[^footnote] is a reusable response to [[Chaos]] from a living being, thereby extending the body.[^inspiration] 

[^footnote]: Comes from Greek _techne_ for craft + _logos_ for system of thought. 

[^inspiration]: This definition is greatly inspired by the essay [What is Technology?](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/What-is-Technology),  in which "technology is a reusable, low-resistance path to achieve some end or goal." 

Technology is biologically grounded, though it need not be suffused with intentionality.[^intentionality] Whether organisms are aware of it or not, evolution gives them technologies with which to survive. But the [[Human]] is a [[Technologist]], an agent specifically adapted to creating new technologies. For our intents and purposes, then, technology is also socially grounded. 

[^intentionality]: People don't always create technology with an end in mind, and technologies often change toward new ends. 


This observation ought to broaden what we consider technology. Michel Foucault gives us this bigger picture in [[Technologies of the Self]].
