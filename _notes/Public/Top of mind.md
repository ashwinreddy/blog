This is a note in the [[Digital Garden]] that collects some of the things I'm working on and thinking about. Inspired by [Andy's](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zUw5PuD8op9oq8kHvni6sug6eRTNtR9Wqma) top of mind.

1. Although we don't need metaphysics, it sure is fun and interesting, and, if applied properly, might also be useful. I think it could be productive to dig deeper into [[Process philosophy]] and see if we can't conceptualize the world in terms of a fundamental [[Chaos]]. To do that, we would need to be clear on what chaos, change, and difference are. [[Deleuze]] will be helpful on some of these points. 
	* What is the mechanism of [[Evolution]]? Maybe we can look at _Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge_. I don't know if Bergson's _Creative Evolution_ is relevant or useful but could be worth a shot.
	* How does [[Emergence]] work? We can look at _Emergence: contemporary readings in philosophy and science_. 
2. I've been interested in the development of [[Artificial Intelligence]] for years now, but I'm not sure where it is going. I'd like to write up an informed critique of the field as I see it. Good place to start is with Hubert Dreyfus.
3. I'm seeing academic disciplines as language-games, where first you learn the basic syntax and semantics of the field but can eventually use the language to generate new lines of thought. Is this what Wittgenstein meant by language game?
4. I'm still trying to figure out if the concept of God is useful or interesting to me. If I do believe in it, it is the God of [[Spinoza's Ethics]]. I'd like to explain what he meant and why it appeals to me.
5. I've found useful ideas in both Zen Buddhism and Stoicism. I'd like to continue learning about both and finding connections between them. Stoic writers include Epictetus, Arrian, Musonius Rufus. Somewhere in this project, I think Nishitani's _Religion and Nothingness_ will come into play. 
6. [Games and Puzzles as Multicomputational Systems](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/games-and-puzzles-as-multicomputational-systems/)
7. Proto-Indo-European mythology
