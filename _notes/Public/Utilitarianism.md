Utilitarianism is a [[Philosophy]] that is about doing the most good for the most people.

* Should we act for the most total utility or average utility?
* Should we try to minimize suffering instead?
* Rule-utilitarians think you can follow rules as general guidelines. 


Effective Altruism is a utilitarian movement. Michael Nielsen has [good notes](https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/) on it.
