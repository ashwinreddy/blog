_[A Clockwork Orange](https://www.worldcat.org/title/clockwork-orange/oclc/1129273623&referer=brief_results)_ is an English [[Novel]] by [[Anthony Burgess]] published in 1962 set in a dystopian future following Alex, a young teen who commits crimes until he's caught and forced to watch videos of horrific crime until he finds violence repulsive. It asks questions about [[Free Will]] and Justice. It's a philosophically interesting novel, as this [blog post](https://www.the-pamphlet.com/articles/human-nature-in-a-clockwork-orange) explains. This [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK-ma6dK3bY) about it is excellent. 

It's a response to [[James Joyce]]'s aesthetic hero (an idea from [[Nietzsche]]).
