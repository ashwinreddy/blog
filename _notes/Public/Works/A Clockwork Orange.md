_[A Clockwork Orange](https://www.worldcat.org/title/clockwork-orange/oclc/1129273623&referer=brief_results)_ is a novel by Anthony Burgess published in 1962 set in a dystopian future following Alex, a young teen who commits crimes until he's caught and forced to watch violence until he finds the thought repulsive. Its main themes are [[Free Will]] and Justice. It's a philosophically interesting novel, as this [blog post](https://www.the-pamphlet.com/articles/human-nature-in-a-clockwork-orange) explains.


This [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK-ma6dK3bY) about it is excellent.
