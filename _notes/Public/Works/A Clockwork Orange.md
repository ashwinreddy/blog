_[A Clockwork Orange](https://www.worldcat.org/title/clockwork-orange/oclc/1129273623&referer=brief_results)_ is a novel and [[Classic book]] by Anthony Burgess set in a dystopian future following  Alex, a young teen who commits crimes until he's caught and forced to watch violence until he finds the thought repulsive. Its main themes are [[Free Will]] and [[Justice]]. It's a philosophically interesting novel, as this [blog post](https://www.the-pamphlet.com/articles/human-nature-in-a-clockwork-orange) explains.
