The _Aeneid_ is an [[Epic poem]] of [[Latin poetry]] and [[Classic book]] written by [[Virgil]]. It tells the story of the founding of what will come to be Rome by the Trojan prince Aeneas. When the ploy of the Trojan horse succeeds and the Greeks set fire to the city, Aeneas flees with his father Anchises and son Ascanius, also known as Iulus. In the first half of the poem, Aeneas and his crew find their way to Italy, similar to the _Odyssey_. In the second half, he prepares for war with the Latins, similar to the _Iliad_.

If the _Iliad_ is about the wrath of Achilles and the _Odyssey_ the cunning of Odysseus, the _Aeneid_ is about the piety of Aeneas.

[^line4]: Transferred epithet. _memorem_ goes with _iram_ but makes more sense with Juno.
