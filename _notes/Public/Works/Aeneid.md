The _Aeneid_ is an epic poem in Latin written by the Roman poet Virgil. It tells the story of the founding of what will come to be Rome by the Trojan prince Aeneas. When the ploy of the Trojan horse succeeds and the Greeks set fire to the city, Aeneas flees with his father Anchises and son Ascanius, also known as Iulus. In the first half of the poem, Aeneas and his crew find their way to Italy, similar to the _Odyssey_. In the second half, he prepares for war with the Latins, similar to the _Iliad_.
