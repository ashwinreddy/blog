_Anti-Oedipus_ is a [[Book]] by [[Deleuze]] and Guattari. D&G see the idea of Oedipus and the idea of desire as lack from Freudian psychoanalysis as incorrect. Desire is not defined by lack, but rather it is a process of experimentation on a plane of immanence. It can form connections enhance the power of bodies. They are trying to de-individualize and de-sexualize desire.
