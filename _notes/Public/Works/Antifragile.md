_Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder_ is a book by Nassim Taleb, about how systems deal with [[Chaos]] and  [[Black Swan]]s. Broadly, there are three categories of systems.

|Type|Figure|Meaning|
|-------|-----|--------|
|Fragile|Damocles|Crumbles under perturbation|
|Robust|Phoenix|Persists under perturbation|
|Antifragile|Hydra|Strengthens under perturbation|

Taleb coins the word _antifragile_, but since he considers time as an example of chaos, there is an existing synonym for antifragile: futureproof.
