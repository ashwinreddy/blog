_Différence et répétition_ (1968) is [[Deleuze]]'s _magnum opus_, which one could see as a response to [[Sein und Zeit]]. It is anti-[[Hegel]]. 

|Aspect|Hegel|Deleuze|
|-------|------|--------|
|[[Being]]|Identity|Difference
|[[Time]]|Negation|Repetition|

Deleuze wants to think difference in itself.
