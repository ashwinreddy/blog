The _Divina Commedia_ is an [[Epic poem]] encapsulating medieval [[Christianity]] written by Dante about his fictional spiritual quest through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven as he is guided by [[Virgil]]. Since he is the protagonist in the poem, we must distinguish Dante the Poet from Dante the Pilgrim. 

* Dante was influenced by [[Ovid]]
