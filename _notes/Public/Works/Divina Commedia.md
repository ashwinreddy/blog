The _Divina Commedia_ is an [[Epic poem]] (a [[Comedy]]?) in vernacular [[Italian]] encapsulating medieval [[Christianity]] written by Dante about his fictional spiritual quest through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven as he is guided by [[Virgil]]. Since he is the protagonist in the poem, we must distinguish Dante the Poet from Dante the Pilgrim. 

In his journeys, Dante sees Homer, [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Caesar]]. 

* Dante was influenced by [[Aquinas]]
