_Empiricism and Subjectivity_ is a book by [[Deleuze]] on [[Hume]]'s [[Empiricism]]. Deleuze disagrees with the emphasis on empiricism saying that knowledge derives from human experience. 

> The classical definition of empiricism proposed by the Kantian tradi- tion is this: empiricism is the theory according to which knowledge not only begins with experience but is derived from it. But why would the empiricist say that? And as the result of which question?

This is a book which is a philosophical critique then, and Deleuze says there are 4 approaches:

1. The question raised by a philosopher is not a good one.
2. We should raise it in a better way.
3. We should raise a different question.
4. It does not force the nature of things enough.

Deleuze wants to focus on the social reality of knowledge. Since the mind is not a constant or universal object (the impressions we have are a perpetual flux, which Deleuze calls imagination), we have to study the mind's affections. And so, the question is

1. How does the mind become human nature?
2. How does a collection become a system?
3. How does the imagination become a faculty?
4. How does the imagination become human nature?
5. How is the subject constituted inside the given?

Deleuze's answer is that the mind is affected by the passional and social.
