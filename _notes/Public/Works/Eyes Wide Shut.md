## Plot

Dr. Bill Harford and his wife Alice attend a party hosted by Bill's patient Victor Ziegler some days before Christmas. Both Bill and Alice interact with guests at the party who try to seduce them. Ziegler calls Bill, a physician, to check on Mandy, who has overdosed. She recovers. When they discuss the party the next day, Alice tells Bill that on holiday she fantasized about leaving Bill and their daughter Helena for a naval officer at their hotel. Bill abruptly gets a call about a patient's death; when he leaves to talk to the patient's daughter Marion, she kisses him and tells him she loves her. Bill is then solicited by a prostitute, whom he only kisses before paying and leaving. Then, he goes to a jazz club to see Nick Nightingale, an old friend from medical school who has dropped out and become a pianist. Nick tells Bill he's playing at a secret event and gives him the password. Bill goes to a costume shop to get a dress. Strangely, the owner of the costume shop catches his daughter with two men and threatens to call the police. Finally, he goes to the event, but it turns out to be a ritual, and the members catch on that Bill shouldn't be there. A masked woman warns him to leave, but when she is caught, she chooses to sacrifice herself.
