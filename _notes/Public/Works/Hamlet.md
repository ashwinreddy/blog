title: "Hamlet"
---

_The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark_ is a play and a [[Classic book]] written by [[Shakespeare]]. One of his longest and most complex plays, it has been an enduring staple of English literature and literary criticism. The critic Harold Bloom calls the play a "Poem Unlimited."

_Hamlet_ is a story about a troubled family. The father, king Hamlet, has mysteriously died, leaving uncle Claudius to take the throne and marry the mother Gertrude. The son, prince Hamlet, has a clear call to action here. But what makes Hamlet interesting and frustrating is his inability to act: his intellect, his seeming awareness that he is in a play, his self-reflexivity all get in the way. He may be the first individual.

To avoid detection by Claudius, Hamlet also pretends to be mad. It is a perennial question whether Hamlet is indeed mad or only putting on an act. In Saxo Grammaticus's _Gesta Danorum_, which contains the basic story of Amleth (his original name), Hamlet's madness is only an act. _[The Northman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11138512/)_ is a sibling text to _Hamlet_ because it derives from _Gesta Danorum_.
