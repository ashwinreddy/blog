_Logic of Sense_ is a book by Gilles [[Deleuze]] published in 1969. It's about [[Carroll]] and [[Stoicism]].


It's about the relation of events and series. An event runs through a series and is transformed by it. It doesn't have a clear start or end. 

The ideal [[Game]] for Deleuze, drawing on Carroll and [[Borges]] and Mallarme is opposed to the known game in which (quoting from James Williams):

1. There is a prior set of categorical rules
2. The rules determine hypotheses diving chance into gains and losses
3. The hypotheses organize the game into distinct plays operating a distribution, falling under different cases.
4. The consequences of play are victory or loss.

But the ideal one has

1. No prior rules, since each play invents and bends to its own rule.
2. The set of plays affirms the whole of chance, branched out at each play, rather than dividing it into numerically distinct plays.
3. Each play is a series as a distribution of singularities, but the set of plays is itself a play of all the singularities.
4. Such a game is the reality of thought rather than any actual reality.
