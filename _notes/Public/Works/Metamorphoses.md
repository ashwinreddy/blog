_Metamorphoses_ (Greek/Latin for transformations) is an [[Epic poem]] ([[Latin poetry]]) and [[Classic book]] by the Roman poet [[Ovid]]. It covers a great number of Greco-Roman mythological stories, beginning with the creation of the world. The thematic connection is change. In the poem, the [[God]]s are just as fickle and shifty as humans.

I like Charles Martin's [translation](https://www.worldcat.org/title/metamorphoses/oclc/52547579) and the Latin text at [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0029%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D1).

|_Quae postquam evolvit caecoque exemit acervo_||
|_dissociata locis concordi pace ligavit._||
