_Metamorphoses_ (Greek/Latin for transformations) is a lengthy narrative poem written in Latin by the Roman poet [[Ovid]]. It covers a great number of Greco-Roman [[Myth]]s, beginning with a creation myth. The thematic connection is change. In the poem, the gods are just as fickle and shifty as humans.

I like Charles Martin's [translation](https://www.worldcat.org/title/metamorphoses/oclc/52547579) and the Latin text at [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0029%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D1). 

## Change

If there is a key line, it would be [this one](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ov.+Met.+15.165&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0029).
