_Moby-Dick_ is a novel written by Herman Melville. The novel follows Ishmael, who, along with harpooner Queequeg, decides to join the _Pequod_ on a whaling expedition. But the ship is led by Captain Ahab, whose only goal is to find and kill Moby-Dick, the whale that bit him years ago.

To my mind, the novel is significant not only for combining the forms of <a href="{% post_url 2022-6-28-epic-essay %}">epic and essay</a> but also for its deep symbolism and spiritual disposition.
