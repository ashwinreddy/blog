_Paradise Lost_ is an [[Epic poem]] and [[Classic book]] in English written by John Milton. In 12 books,[^number-books] it retells the story of Adam and Eve, the first [[Human]]s, from the book of Genesis in the Old Testament, explicitly introducing Satan as the one who adopts the form of the serpent and tempts Eve. Paradise Lost is Milton's attempt to create a great epic poem in the English language. The poem is notable for its use of blank verse rather than any rhyme scheme. 

[^number-books]: It was originally 10 books. The choice of 12 books reminds us of the structure of the [[Aeneid]].
