_Paradise Lost_ is an epic poem in English written by John Milton. In 12 books,[^number-books] it retells the story of Adam and Eve from the book of Genesis in the Old Testament, explicitly introducing Satan as the one who adopts the form of the serpent and tempts Eve. Paradise Lost is Milton's attempt to create a great epic poem in the English language, although in [A preface to Paradise Lost](https://www.worldcat.org/title/preface-to-paradise-lost/oclc/1269090815&referer=brief_results), C.S. Lewis categorizes _Paradise Lost_ as a secondary epic, in the sense that it is a literary production rather than an oral tradition. The poem is notable for its use of blank verse rather than rhyme. 

[^number-books]: It was originally 10 books. The choice of 12 books reminds us of the structure of the [[Aeneid]].
