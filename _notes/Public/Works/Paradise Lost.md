_Paradise Lost_ is an [[Public/English]] [[Epic poem]] written by [[Milton]]. Suffused in allusions to [[Bible]] and [[Christianity]]'s [[Myth]] and thinking, the poem covers in 12 books,[^number-books] the story of Satan, having fallen from God, attempting to revenge himself by assuming the form of a serpent and tempting Adam and Eve, the first humans, from the book of Genesis in the Old Testament. Paradise Lost is Milton's attempt to create a great epic poem in the English language and to "justify the ways of God to men". The poem is notable for its use of blank verse rather than rhyme. 

[^number-books]: It was originally 10 books. The choice of 12 books reminds us of the structure of the [[Aeneid]].
