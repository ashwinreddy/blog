[Technologies of the Self](https://www.worldcat.org/title/technologies-of-the-self-a-seminar-with-michel-foucault/oclc/988085468&referer=brief_results) was a seminar by Michel Foucault in 1982 in which he traces the "development of the hermeneutics of the self" in Platonic and Hellenistic thought and in Western Christian monasticism. In 1976, Foucault published _[The History of Sexuality](https://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-sexuality-an-introduction/oclc/1156091497&referer=brief_results)_, and he talks about how this led him to become interested in technologies of the self.

> I conceived of a rather odd project: not the evolution of sexual behavior but the projection of a history of the link between the obligation to tell the truth and the prohibitions against sexuality. I asked: How had the subject been compelled to decipher himself in regard to what was forbidden? It is a question of the relation between asceticism and truth. 


Foucault starts with _gnothi sauton_ (know thyself), the most important moral principle for ancient Greek philosophy.
