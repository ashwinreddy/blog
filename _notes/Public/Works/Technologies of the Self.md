[Technologies of the Self](https://www.worldcat.org/title/technologies-of-the-self-a-seminar-with-michel-foucault/oclc/988085468&referer=brief_results) was a 1928 seminar by [[Foucault]] tracing the "development of the hermeneutics of the self" as a [Technology]] in [[Platonism]], [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and Western Christian monasticism . Foucault had published _[The History of Sexuality](https://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-sexuality-an-introduction/oclc/1156091497&referer=brief_results)_ in 1976, and he talks about how this led him to become interested in technologies of the self.

> I conceived of a rather odd project: not the evolution of sexual behavior but the projection of a history of the link between the obligation to tell the truth and the prohibitions against sexuality. I asked: How had the subject been compelled to decipher himself in regard to what was forbidden? It is a question of the relation between asceticism and truth. 

There are 4 major types of technologies.

|Type|Ability|
|----|-------|
|Production|Produce, transform, manipulate things|
|Sign systems ([[Semiotics]])|Use signs, meanings, symbols, or signification|
|Power|Turn other individuals into objects for some end|
|Self|Let individuals effect their own means or transform themselves|

He starts with _epimelesthai sauton_ (take care of yourself) and _gnothi sauton_ (know yourself in _[[Alcibiades]]_ and _[[Apology]]_. It appears also in Christian asceticism and [[Epicureanism]]. But the latter has overtaken the latter because knowledge of the self took priority in philosophy (Foucault points to theory from [[Descartes]] to Husserl) and religion.

These communities placed a great focus on [[Reading]] and [[Writing]] as a technique for knowing the self.
