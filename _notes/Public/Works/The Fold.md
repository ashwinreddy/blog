> everything folds, unfolds, refolds

_le pli: leibnitz et le baroque_ is a book by [[deleuze]]. the goal of the book is to show the fold is a figure and form of almost infinite conceptual force in the baroque age. deleuze wants to focus on [[leibniz]] whose monads he thinks falls under the baroque. 

deleuze puts leibniz in conversation with [[descartes]]. 


on [[leibniz]] and baroque architecture, which he says functions by endlessly producing, twisting, turning folds on itself to infinity in two places:

- Pleats of matter
- Folds in the soul

There is a correspondence between the two labyrinths.

> A multiplicity is not what has many parts. It is what is "complicated," or folded many times over and in many ways such that there is no completely unfolded state, but only further bifurcations, as in [[borges]]' fable of the garden of ever-forking paths. -- [[deleuze connections]]
