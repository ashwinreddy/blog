_Le pli: Leibnitz et le Baroque_ is a book by [[Deleuze]] on [[Leibniz]] and Baroque architecture, which he says functions by endlessly producing, twisting, turning folds on itself to infinity in two places:
- Pleats of matter
- Folds in the soul
There is a correspondence between the two labyrinths.
