_Le pli: Leibnitz et le Baroque_ is a book by [[Deleuze]] on [[Leibniz]] and [[Monad]]s and the Baroque architecture. 

The Baroque functions by endlessly producing, twisting, turning folds on itself to infinity in two places:

- Pleats of matter
- Folds in the soul

There is a correspondence between the two labyrinths.
