_Qu'est-ce que fonder?_ is a seminar by [[Gilles Deleuze]] from 1956-7. 


At the start of the seminar, Deleuze distinguished [[Philosophy]] from [[Myth]]. 

## Natural Ends and Infinite Tasks

Deleuze starts by noting that while humans have natural ends they pursue, they also engage in ceremonies and rituals that raise nature to the level of history and realize natural ends in indirect ways. _Example_: The family shares food, sexuality, sleep, and death. 

Now, transforming a natural end into a cultural end renders it infinite. _Example_: "I love you" rather than "I desire you" is an infinite task. In [[Myth]], we are presented the state of infinite tasks, but the point is that they cannot be realized. For example, the gods are immortal because they always drink ambrosia or amrita, etc. 

Why should we create infinite tasks? They allow us to realize natural ends in a way that is no longer simply direct. For this reason, cynics are anti-philosophical; they deny natural ends can be transformed into infinite ones. The issue here is that natural ends are not yet ends of reason but values or sentiments to be felt and lived. The proper end of reason, when thought commits to realizing itself, is realizing infinite tasks.

We have indirect means (by way of rituals and ceremonies), natural ends (biological necessities), felt cultural ends (the ritualized end), cutural ends of reason (infinite tasks). Parentheticals are my guesses.

## Will, Value, Ground

To ground
: To raise nature to the level of history and of spirit/mind

To propose a value is to appeal to a ground.

> So when does the problem of grounding become philosophical? From the moment when the grounder proposes infinite tasks to us as something to be realized in this world itself.
