_Qu'est-ce que fonder?_ is a seminar by [[Deleuze]] from 1956-7. 

- The introductory portion had something to do with [[Myth]] and [[Odyssey]]. 
- Humans have natural ends they pursue, and that is well and good.
- But society's [[ritual]], its mythology presents us with infinite tasks.
- When thought commits to realizing itself, the proper end of reason is the realization of infinite tasks.
