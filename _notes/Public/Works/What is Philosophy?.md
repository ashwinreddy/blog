> But those who criticize without creating, those who are content to defend the vanished concept without being able to give it the forces it needs to return to life, are the plague of philosophy.

_What is Philosophy?_ is a book by [[Deleuze]] and Felix Guattari. It's about [[Chaos]], [[Philosophy]], [[Art]], and [[Science]].  

## Introduction

D&G introduce the idea that philosophy is about the creation of concepts. Over time, philosophy has forgotten about it.

> Closer to our own time, philosophy has encountered many new rivals. To start with, the human sciences and especially sociology, wanted to replace it. But because philosophy, taking refuge in universals, increasingly misunderstood its vocation for creating concepts, it was no longer clear what was at stake. Was it a matter of giving up the creation of concepts in favor of a rigorous human science or, alternatively, of transforming the nature of concepts by turning them into the collective representations of worldviews created by the vital, historical, and spiritual forces of different peoples? Then it was the turn of epistemology, of linguistics, or even of psychoanalysis and logical analysis. In successive challenges, philosophy confronted increasingly insolent and calamitous rivals that Plato himself would never have imagined in his most comic moments. Finally, the most shameful moment came when computer science, marketing, design, and advertising, all the disciplines of communication, seized hold of the word _concept_ itself and said: "This is our concern, we are the creative ones, we are the _ideas men_! We are the friends of the concept, we put it in our computers."

## Concepts

We will start with the example D&G use, that of Descartes' _I_, a concept of self. 

Concepts neeed conceptual personae (_personnages conceptuels_). Concepts are signed. Concepts have history. For example, _Friend_ reveals the idea that a [[Philosopher]] is not a [[Sage]] but the seeker of wisdom. They are a friend, lover, claimant, and rival.
