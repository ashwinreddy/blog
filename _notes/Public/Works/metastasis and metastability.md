> [[weiner]] himself somewhat poetically likens the human condition as being on a metaphorical island surrounded by entropy. 

_metastasis and metastability_ is a book that presents the possibility that [[deleuze]]'s [[difference]] is synonymous with [[information]] and considers how it connects with [[cybernetics]]. 

first, what is information? is it a quality, a quantity, a relation, or a modality? 

> any attempt of constructing a philosophy of information as a foundation upon which we can compare to a philosophy of the [[virtual]] will be essential to the two subsequent steps: an ontological description of information in a meta-state, and a deleuzian approach to (and ostensible critique of) [[information theory]].


when information is non-physical, it is treated like [[probability]]; after all, information is the measure of the probability of an event. 

we start with [[fisher]]'s account. fisher wants to know how a sample or experiment reduces uncertainty. then we go to weiner. he says

> information is information, not matter or energy.

he opposes information to entropy. then there is shannon, who connects information to [[entropy]] and [[surprise]]. really, he needed a technical definition for communication. then there is krippendorff's definition

> a measure of the _amount of selective work_ a message enables its receiver to do

for him, entropy is

> a measure of _observational variety_ of actual (as opposed to logically possible) diversity
