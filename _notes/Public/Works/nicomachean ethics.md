_nicomachean ethics_ is a book by [[aristotle]] written in [[greek]].  he classed knowledge into [[episteme]], [[techne]], and phronesis. 

in 1140a, he writes

> all [[art]] deals with bringing some thing into existence; and to pursue an art means to study how to bring into existence a thing which may either exist or not, and the efficient cause of which lies in the maker and not in the thing made; for art does not deal with things that exist or come into existence of necessity, or according to nature, since these have their efficient cause in themselves
