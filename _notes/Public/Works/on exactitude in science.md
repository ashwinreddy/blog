on exactitude in science is a short story by [[borges]]. the title suggests an allegory about [[science]]. it inspired [[eco]] and [[baudrillard]]. 

## on the impossibility of drawing a map of the empire on a scale of 1 to 1

such a map (and not a plaster cast) would have to be coextensive with the territory. and you can't put the map in the desert of a different, larger empire. and it is a single map, not an [[atlas]]. and it has to be a semiotic tool, therefore cannot be a transparent sheet. 

you could put an opaque map over the territory, but then you'd have to correct for the disruption of sunlight and atmosphere.
