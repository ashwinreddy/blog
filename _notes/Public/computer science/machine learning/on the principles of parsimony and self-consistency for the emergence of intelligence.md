the position paper @ma2022principles looks to two principles for [[intelligence]]. 


|value|field|
|----|------|
|parsimony|[[information theory]]|
|self-consistency|[[cybernetics]]|

## parsimony

parsimony
: obtaining compact and structured representations via computationally efficient means

the task is to take a sensory data sample $\boldsymbol{x}$ and represent it compactly.

$$
\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbf{R}^D \xrightarrow{f(\boldsymbol{x}, \theta)} \boldsymbol{z} \in \mathbf{R}^d
$$

- **compression**
- **linearization**
- **sparsification**

## self-consistency

self-consistency
: minimal discrepancy between the observed world and the one regenerated from the model


## a broader program for intelligence

the authors look toward cybernetics, citing [[weiner]]:

> if i were to choose a patron saint for cybernetics out of the history of science, i should have to choose [[leibniz]]. the philosophy of leibniz centers about two closely related concepts â€“ that of a universal symbolism and that of a calculus of reasoning
