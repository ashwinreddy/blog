> [[fisher]] was concerned not with [[information]] as communication but with statistical estimation with respect to experimentation practices. fisher information is useful in quantifying how much information is gained or lost in making a measurement to acquire a [[statistic]], which can for example lead to an estimate of an underlying distribution. -- [[metastasis and metastability]]


fisher information is the information that a [[random variable]] $X$ gives us about its parameter $\theta$. It is the [[variance]] of the [[Score]].

$$
\mathcal{I}(\theta) = \mathbb{V}\left[\ell'(\theta \mid x)\right].
$$


for a statistic $T$ of the data $X^n$,

$$
I_{X^n}(\theta) \geqslant I_T(\theta)
$$
