title: "Senior Thesis"
---

I have learnt so much in college that I've not yet articulated. Hence, this blog post to say I'm working on an unofficial and informal senior thesis as a capstone to the work I've done so far. 

The core concept is that games provide a useful and flexible framework for thinking about autonomous intelligence, both for humans and machines. 

**Step 1**. We define a game. To do this, we need a double-edged definition, one side to capture captures the mathematical form (_Ludonomy_) and one for the more fluid aspect of language and play (which Ludwig Wittgenstein coined _Sprachspiel_). 

**Step 2**. We see that even science, art, philosophy, and math, work with games. All games express both aspects, but people, depending on their field, view them differently. 

**Step 3**. The great distinction between _Ludonomy_ and _Sprachspiel_ is whether one can solve the game conclusively or not. Solving a game kills it, but we create new games in its wake. 

**Step 4**. The threat posed, we see that games are only viable while they have a little chaos in them. Therefore, a game has to show signs of emergence as a system. 

**Step 5**. Which finally leads us to a discussion of how we can think about games and recent advances in machine learning to think about fruitful and fun places to find intelligence.
