title: "Senior Thesis"
---

I have learnt so much in college that I've not yet articulated. Hence, this blog post to say I'm working on an unofficial and informal senior thesis as a capstone to the work I've done so far. 

The core concept is that games provide a useful and flexible framework for thinking about autonomous intelligence, both for humans and machines. To see this, we need a double-edged definition of a game, one which captures the mathematical, formal structure (which I'm tentatively calling _Ludonomy_) and one which captures the more fluid, playful aspects (which Ludwig Wittgenstein identified with his term _Sprachspiel_). Having defined these, we can start to see how all games express both aspects at once, and people in any endeavor or discipline take up their personal games with different notions about these two aspects of the game and what exactly they're up to when they're playing their game. This question, what divides _Ludonomy_ and _Sprachspiel_, often reduces to whether one can solve the game conclusively or not. Solving a game kills it, and the threat posed leads us to see that all viable games must have a little bit of chaos in them. Therefore, a game has to show signs of emergence as a system. Which finally leads us to a discussion of how we can think about games and recent advances in machine learning to think about fruitful and fun places to find intelligence.
