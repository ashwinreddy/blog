title: "Getting into Philosophy"

Getting into philosophy is rewarding but difficult. Here are my recommendations for beginners.

* Philosophy can get overwhelming real quick, so start with what's interesting, enjoyable, and intelligible. For me, that was Marcus Aurelius' _Meditations_. I think Stoicism is a [great place]({% post_url 2022-5-25-stoicism %}) to start for many.
* Good resources for general background are the podcast [Philosophize This](https://www.philosophizethis.org/) and Will Durant's _Story of Philosophy_, which goes through about a dozen big names in the western canon of philosophy. 
* Reading philosophy is a hard skill, but Ellie Anderson has [good advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pj26s8u6Vo) about how to develop it. (Her whole channel is great.)
* When you get confused about why you're reading philosophy, remember there are at least 4 ways of thinking about what philosophy does.
    - Philosophy is the creation of concepts and determining which ones hold to scrutiny. (Deleuze)
    - Philosophy is a way of life. It gives you a program for determining what to do in tricky real world scenarios. (Seneca)
    - Philosophy is therapy. It dispels misconceptions that hinder us. (Wittgenstein)
    - Philosophy is a discussion. It's about finding better ways of expressing ourselves. (Rorty)

P.S. I'm planning to follow [Susan Rigetti's guide](https://www.susanrigetti.com/philosophy) to flesh out my understanding.
