title: "Reading List for Deleuze"
---

Gilles Deleuze's ouevre is difficult to penetrate precisely because you can start from almost anywhere. I'll be updating this post with the reading order that makes the most sense to me. My sense is that each person will have to find their own way in, but I figure it's helpful to record what I've found works. 

1. [The Beginner’s Guide to Deleuze](http://htmlgiant.com/random/the-beginners-guide-to-deleuze/).
2. Deleuze's essays are often self-contained, so use these as samplers.
    - "Desert Islands"
    - "Instincts and Institutions"
    - "Letter to a Harsh Critic"
3. _L'Abécédaire de Gilles Deleuze_. 26 interviews with Deleuze from "Animal" to "Zigzag." _Mirabile visu_.
5. Will Durant's _Story of Philosophy_. Deleuze is apprentice to three figures covered in this book: [[Spinoza]], [[Nietzche]], [[Bergson]]. Plus, you learn about [[Plato]], [[Kant]], and [[Hegel]], who are also key.
6. Spinoza's _Ethics_. (I own [this edition](https://www.worldcat.org/title/spinozas-ethics/oclc/859948295) and highly recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-vNQhMCm_A).) I couldn't make sense of it all in one read. Plan to return to this one.
7. _Spinoza: Practical Philosophy_
8. For when you get confused by Deleuze's obscure language: [Using Bourdieu to critique Deleuze's style](https://www.arasite.org/delelitism.html)
9. Deleuze and Guattari's _What is Philosophy?_ This book is probably the easiest of Deleuze's original books to start with.

<!-- Below this line is my plan of attack for the rest of his work.

2. John Protevi's [notes](http://www.protevi.com/john/LearnDR.pdf) on Difference and Repetition.
3. Difference & Repetition, Chapter 3.
4. Deleuze's Philosophical Lineage by Graham Jones and Jon Roffe.
5. _The Works of Gilles Deleuze I: 1953-1969_ Jon Roffe
6. [The Deleuze Seminars](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/)
7. _A Thousand Plateaus_
8. _Anti-Oedipus_
9. _The Logic of Sense_
11. Dialogues
12. Protevi's [website](http://www.protevi.com/john/DG/)
13. What is Grounding?
