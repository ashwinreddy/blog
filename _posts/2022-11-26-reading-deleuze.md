title: "Reading List for Deleuze"
---

Gilles Deleuze's ouevre is difficult to penetrate precisely because you can start from almost anywhere. I'll be updating this post with the reading order that makes the most sense to me. My sense is that each person will have to find their own way in, but I figure it's helpful to record what I've learned. 

1. [The Beginner’s Guide to Deleuze](http://htmlgiant.com/random/the-beginners-guide-to-deleuze/).
2. Deleuze's essays are mostly self-contained, so use these as samplers.
    - "Desert Islands"
    - "Instincts and Institutions"
    - "Letter to a Harsh Critic"
3. Deleuze and Guattari's _What is Philosophy?_ This book is probably the easiest to start with.
4. Will Durant's _Story of Philosophy_. It covers the three big figures for Deleuze -- Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson. Plus, you learn about Plato, Kant, and Hegel. 
5. Spinoza's _Ethics_. (I own [this edition](https://www.worldcat.org/title/spinozas-ethics/oclc/859948295) and highly recommend [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-vNQhMCm_A).) I couldn't make sense of it all in one read. Plan to return to this one.
6. _Spinoza: Practical Philosophy_

<!-- Below this line is my plan of attack for the rest of his work.
