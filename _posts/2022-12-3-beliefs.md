title: "What I believe in"
---

I just read my friend Sarv's [post](https://sarvasvkulpati.com/blog/believe) of this same name and felt like I needed one of my own as well.

# What do I believe in?

- To be a human is to create and to experiment with what life could be (sometimes the creations are monstrous). 
- Creation and experimentation requires both theory and practice in the right proportions.
- Most ideas are bad or worthless, what matters is an intuition for which ones are worth trying and the willingness to see them through.
- Rationality that does not acknowledge what it does not know or understand is rigid, inflexible, ultimately intractable.

# What do I like?

- Learning. I think I'm fairly high in openness.
- Gray, foggy skies and a hot cup of tea in the morning.
- Discovering what a medium (text, film, audio, games, etc.) can do.
- Mythology, especially Proto-Indo-European.
- Literature and Philosophy, which I think are two sides of the same coin.
- Building things in increments

# What do I think is important?

- Selecting words with care because the language we use to describe our world matters. Especially the metaphors.
- The value of [[play]]
- Calibrated uncertainty, i.e. calculated risk
