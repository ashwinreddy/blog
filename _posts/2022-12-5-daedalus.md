title: "Daedalus"

Ovid tells the story of Daedalus and Icarus in _Metamorphoses_ 8.183-235. The translation below is a little bumpy in places because I've tried to make each English line correspond to the Latin line.

|Latin|English|
|-----|-------|
|_Daedalus interea Creten longumque perosus_|Daedalus, meanwhile, loathing Crete and the long|
|_exsilium tactusque loci natalis amore_|Exile, influenced by love of his homeland,|
|_clausus erat pelago. "Terras licet" inquit "et undas"_|Was trapped by the sea. Granted, he said, the earth and sea|
|_obstruat: at caelum certe patet; ibimus illac._|Block me. But the sky certainly is open; we will go that way.|
|_Omnia possideat, non possidet aera Minos._|He may own everything, but Minos does not own air.|
|_Dixit et ignotas animum dimittit in artes_[^joyce]|He said this and turned his mind to unknown arts|
|_naturamque novat. Nam ponit in ordine pennas_|And he changed nature. For he placed wings in rows|
|_a minima coeptas, longam breviore sequenti,_|Beginning from the smallest, with shorter following long|
|_ut clivo crevisse putes. Sic rustica quondam_|So that you'd think they grew on a slope. Thus once a rustic|
|_fistula disparibus paulatim surgit avenis._|Pipe little by little grows, made by unequal reeds.|
|_Tum lino medias et ceris adligat imas,_|Then he bound together the middle with flax and the inmost with wax,|
|_atque ita compositas parvo curvamine flectit,_|And so he bends the constructions with a small curve,|
|_ut veras imitetur aves. Puer Icarus una_|As if he were copying real birds. The boy Icarus|
|_stabat et, ignarus sua se tractare pericla,_|stood there and ignorant of his own danger in handling things|
|_ore renidenti modo, quas vaga moverat aura,_|with his mouth gleaming, which by the wandering breeze|
|_captabat plumas, flavam modo pollice ceram_|plumes moved, he would catch, and with thumb the golden wax|
|_mollibat lusuque suo mirabile patris_|Soften and playing with his father's marvelous|
|_impediebat opus. Postquam manus ultima coepto_|Work impede. After the hand by the last undertaking|
|_imposita est, geminas opifex libravit in alas_|Was set down, the workman balanced into twin wings|
|_ipse suum corpus motaque pependit in aura._|His own body and he hung in the stirring wind.|
|_Instruit et natum "medio" que "ut limite curras,_|He teaches also his son, "You should run in the middle as the path,"|
|_Icare," ait, "moneo, ne, si demissior ibis_|"Icarus," he says, "I warn you, if you fly the lower path,|
|_unda gravet pennas, si celsior, ignis adurat_|The waves will weigh down the feathers, and if higher, the sun will scorch them|
|_Inter utrumque vola. Nec te spectare Booten_|So fly between the two. And that you not look at Bootes,|
|_aut Helicen iubeo strictumque Orionis ensem:_|Or Helicen, I ask, or the sword of Orion|
|_me duce carpe viam." Pariter praecepta volandi_|With me as leader, take the way." Likewise, the lessons of flying|
|_tradit et ignotas umeris accomodat alas_.|He hands over and adjusts the unknown wings onto shoulders.|
|_Inter opus monitusque genae maduere seniles_|During the work and the warnings, the old cheeks dripped with tears|
|_et patriae temuere manus. Dedit oscula nato_|And the hands of the father trembled. He gave kisses to his son|
|_non iterum repetenda suo, pennisque levatus_|That would not be returned to him again, and supported by wings|
|_ante volat comitique timet, velut ales, ab alto_|First he flies and fears for his companion, as if a bird from a high|
|_quae teneram prolem produxit in aera nido_|Nest who led forth in air young offspring|
|_hortaturque sequi damnosasque erudit artes_|And urges them to follow and teaches them the ruinous art|
|_et movet ipse suas et nati respicit alas_|And moves her own by herself and looks back on the wings of her child|
|_Hos aliquis tremula dum captat harundine pisces_|Trembling while she captures these fish by some reed|
|_aut pastor baculo stivave innixus arator_|And the shepherd resting on a stick or, if you like, a farmer|
|_vidit et obstipuit quique aethera carpere possent_|Saw and was amazed by they who could seize heaven|
|_credidit esse deos. Et iam Iunonia laeva_|And he believed them to be gods. And now on the left Junonian|
|_parte Samos (fuerant Delosque Parosque relictae)_|Samos (both Delos and Paros were left behind)|
|_dextra Lebinthos erat fecundaque melle Calymne_|On the right was Lebinthos and Calymne abundant in honey|
|_cum puer audaci coepit gaudere volatu_|When the boy began to rejoice in bold flight|
|_deseruitque ducem caelique cupidine tractus_|And he left the leader and dragged by desire of the sky|
|_altius egit iter. Rapidi vicinia solis_|He goes a higher path. The nearness of the swift sun|
|_mollit odoratas, pennarum vincula, ceras_|Softens the fragrant wax, the chains of the wings|
|_Tabuerant cerae: nudos quatit ille lacertos,_|Had melted of wax: The boy shakes his bare arms|
|_remigioque carens non ullas percipit auras_|And lacking oarage he does not secure the wind|
|_oraque caerulea patrium clamantia nomen_|And his mouth's shouting of the name of the father by the blue|
|_excipiuntur aqua: quae nomen traxit ab illo_|Sea is received: which name it got from him.|
|_At pater infelix nec iam pater 'Icare' dixit_|But the unlucky father is now not a father, "Icarus," he said|
|_'Icare' dixit, 'ubi es? qua te regione requiram'_|"Icarus," he said, "Where are you? Where should I find you?"|
|_"Icare," dicebat: pennas adspexit in undis_|"Icarus," he kept saying: he saw the wings in waves|
|_devovitque suas artes corpusque sepulcro_|And cursed his own arts and the body in a tomb|
|_condidit, et tellus a nomine dicta sepulti_|He places and the ground was called by the name of the burial.|


<!-- |_Hunc miseri tumulo ponentem corpora nati_|The body of the poor son on this foundation in the tomb|
|_garrula limoso prospexit ab elice perdix_|Swampy, the chatty partridge foresaw from the drain|
|_et plausit pennis testataque gaudia cantu est:_|And beat its wings and is bearing witness in a happy song|
|_unica tunc volucris nec visa prioribus annis,_|Then the sole bird never seen in years before|
|_factaque nuper avis, longum tibi, Daedale, crimen._|And a bird made recently, a tall verdict to you, Daedalus.|
|_Namque huic tradiderat, fatorum ignara, docendam_|For the sister, unaware of fates, had handed over to be taught|
|_progeniem germana suam, natalibus actis_|Her own offspring, with birthdays|
|_bis puerum senis, animi ad praecepta capacis_|twelve passed, the boy for the fit lessons.|
|_Ille etiam medio spinas in pisce notatas_|Now he drew spines etched in the middle of fish|
|_traxit in exemplum ferroque incidit acuto_|Into a pattern and cut with sharpened iron|
|_perpetuos dentes et serrae repperit usum_|the whole teeth and he found the use of saw|
|_Primus et ex uno duo ferrea bracchia nodo_|First and he bound from one place two iron arms|
|_vinxit, ut aequali spatio distantibus illis_|so that an equal space with them separated|
|_altera pars staret, pars altera duceret orbem._|One part remained, another part traced out a circle.|
|_Daedalus invidit sacraque ex arce Minervae_|Daedalus envied him and from the sacred bow of Minerva|
|_praecipitem misit, lapsum mentitus. At illum_|He flung the boy headlong, lying that it was a slip. But that boy|
|_quae favet ingeniis excepit Pallas avemque_|Favored for his ingenuities, Pallas saves and into a bird|
|_reddidit et medio velavit in aere pennis._|She rendered him and veiled him in the middle of the air with wings.|
|_Sed vigor ingenii quondam velocis in alas_|But the vigor of formerly wit passed into swift wings|
|_inque pedes abiit: nomen quod et ante remansit_|And feet: which name he had before he keeps.|
|_Non tamen haec alte volucris sua corpora tollit,_|Still the bird did not lift her own body on high|
|_nec facit in ramis altoque cacumine nidos:_|And she does not make nests in branches and in tall peaks:|
|_propter humum volitat ponitque in saepibus ova_|Because she hovers above the ground and places eggs in hedges|
|_antiquique memor metuit sublimia casus_|Mindful of that old fall, she fears lofty places.| -->

There's a famous painting _Landscape with the Fall of Icarus_ based on this poem:

This painting shows up in W.H. Auden's "Musee des Beaux Arts."
