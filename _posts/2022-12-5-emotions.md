title: "Affective Theories"

We need technical words for virtues and emotions because they are the cardinal directions in our social landscape. Once upon a time, Aristotle and Spinoza tried to give shape to the [virtues](https://www.cwu.edu/~warren/Unit1/aristotles_virtues_and_vices.htm) and [emotions](https://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/spinozasemotions.html), but we have more clarity now.

I don't just mean something  like the excellent [Twelve Virtues of Rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7ZqGiPHTpiDMwqMN2/twelve-virtues-of-rationality). The point is that human behavior can be understood as a system in which virtues and emotions are certain patterns or modes of behavior that accomplish an end.

Imagine then, that you are not a person as such, but the collective organization -- an economy, a society, a republic -- of atoms, organelles, cells, tissues, etc. As an an agent, you are tasked with determining how to OODA (orient, observe, decide, and act). 

Affective neuroscience gives 7 systems: SEEKING, RAGE, FEAR, LUST, CARE, GRIEF, PLAY. The Big Five Theory focuses on traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism with metastates stability (Ludonomy) and plasticity (Sprachspiel). Each of these has a cybernetic function as well.[^cybernetic-big-5]

|Trait|Function|
|-----|--------|
|Extraversion|Exploration and engagement with rewards|
|Neuroticism|Defensive responses to uncertainty, threat, and punishment|
|Openness/Intellect|Cognitive exploration and engagement with information|
|Conscientiousness|Protection of non-immediate or abstract goals and strategies from disruption|
|Agreeableness|Altruism and cooperation; coordination of goals, interpretations, and strategies with those of others|

It's also important to account for [[Transformative Experience]]. Art, for example, is a channel/medium by which we can engender transformative experiences in the self-machine. And perhaps there is a way of looking at life as a sequences of such transformations.
