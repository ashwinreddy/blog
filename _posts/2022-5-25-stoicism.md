title: "Start with Stoicism"
---

Earlier this year, I met up with an old friend who was a little lost in life. We gradually found ourselves in the bookstore, where all good conversations thrive. I pointed toward Marcus Aurelius’ _Meditations_. “That’s the book you want,” I said. It’s become a trusty companion, often hiding in my backpack since I read it a year ago.

If you have any interest in practical wisdom, Greco-Roman history, or Western philosophy / literature, a great place to start is by learning about Stoicism, the school of philosophy to which _Meditations_ belongs.

First, the Stoics are ultra-accessible. Especially with their resurgence in the modern age, it is easy to find their works online and in bookstores. Moreover, the Stoics sought practical wisdom, so their books revolve around familiar situations like wanting to stay in bed in the morning or living in the city near a noisy bathhouse. And while they had a doctrine, it was not their focus. Instead, their work invites you to skip around, skim, and take what you find relevant and useful: _Meditations_ is Aurelius’ diary of reminders and precepts, Seneca’s _Epistles_ are letters to a friend on specific subjects, and Epictetus’ _Enchiridion_  is a handbook. All of them are written in clear, straightforward prose.

Second, the Stoics provide an easy entry into the philosophy and history of the ancient world. They come onto the scene just after Socrates and Plato, widely considered the fathers of Western philosophy. You could start by reading the Stoics (and other Hellenistic philosophers) and then see how Plato influenced them. In addition, the Stoics — we’ve mentioned Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus — constitute a range of real-life characters who practiced what they preached. In learning about these figures, you will naturally pick up context about the ancient Greco-Roman world, which offers many digressions for the curious reader.

Finally, the Stoics remain relevant in the intellectual discourse. The English word ‘stoic’ has come to mean something different from its original meaning, so people don't see it when it pops up in earnest. For fans of literature and philosophy, you can find careful allusions or tributes to the Stoics in Montaigne, Shakespeare, Melville, Nietzsche, and Foucault.

If you want to dive right in, I would recommend Gregory Hays' _Meditations: A New Translation_. Don't get too carried away, though. As Ward Farnsworth says in _The Practicing Stoic_, Stoicism is an ideal. We're always practicing.
