No. But if I explained why not, I would be giving you a worldview, at least a slice of one.

It's not a yes/no question, but one of engagement/disengagement. Just like how skeptics are philosophers that reject philosophy. They look like a counterforce to mainstream philosophy, but they play by the rules of the game. They engage with the rest of the discourse, and that is necessary and sufficient to be part of the conversation. 

There is no worldview without important questions or problems. But (if you don't agree, pay more attention) there are all sorts of issues to think about. At some point, this life will call on you to answer a few. 

The mind wants easy answers. If you haven’t thought about the issue specifically — learning the relevant facts and making a decision — assume you are following the crowd or using basic intuition. These are usually low resolution answers. 

Do your homework. Hume's work, for example, includes an influential critique of causality. If you're interested in causality, you'll want to be familiar with it. Note that we're picking _who_ we read on the basis of authority, but not acceping _what_ we believe on that basis. Only accept the argument if it persuades, but seek the best understanding.

I like the analogy to a conversation in which you can disagree with your interlocutor. However, seeing as you want to get to the bottom of things, you give them the space to make their point, note where you agree and disagree, and critique the strongest version of their position. To not do the basic research is interrupting the conversation.[^caveat] Your point may already have been covered, perhaps in better terms than you could articulate. If you want to disagree, you have the best chance of being understood if you know how people currently think about the topic.[^read]

[^read]: To do this in practice, we need basic literacy in all the big disciplines. How? By reading.

[^caveat]: You do not need to be an expert to speak up. But a working familiarity with existing ideas goes a long way.

Now that you have some facts and arguments on the table, you can decide what you think. The most important quality in one’s thinking is that you _show your work_. Make your reasons for believing things easily understood. This is more important than being correct for the simple reason that you should expect to be wrong often. Ergo, you want your thinking to be easily rectified, not correct per se. Once there is an objection, you can decide what kind of edit is warranted. For cognitively demanding problems, many iterations of feedback and editing will be necessary. Until you are clear on what you think, progress is difficult.

Writing is a useful technology here. If you can put down your thoughts on paper, then you can see the substance behind your thinking. You can start to probe and prod your argument.

<!-- Now, we should talk about where to get the raw materials for thought. About daring to know, about being self-reliant. About breaking things down to their first principles. -->

Developing a worldview is effortful, and the mental path of least resistance avoids doing work. To find evidence that goes against our own viewpoint is hard. It is also the key to science.

But that’s just my take.
