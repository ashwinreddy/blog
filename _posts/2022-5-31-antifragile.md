In the last note, I proposed that chaos is the fundamental force, and organisms thrive when they harness it. I want to see what this observation implies about how we should conduct ourselves.

If we see the world as chaotic (in the neutral, not malicious, sense) then we would want a way of living that acknowledges this, makes sense of it, even takes advantage of it. We saw that Camus put chaos at the core of his philosophy (he called it ‘the absurd’), but ceding to it so completely seems a mistake. It amounts to giving up too quickly.

Nassim Taleb gives us a helpful way of perceiving chaos. In his book _Antifragile_, he categorizes systems based on their response to shock in three ways.

1. Fragile systems degrade or regress after shock.
2. Robust/resilient systems stay more or less the same after shock.
3. Antifragile systems improve after shock.


Our ethic is straightforward: identify the major systems in our life, excise the fragile ones that yield no benefit, make the fragile ones robust, then make the robust ones antifragile, if possible.

The clarity we win here comes at a cost, though. For contrast, look at Christianity. There, they must answer the **problem of evil**, looking for the reason why God allows evil and suffering. On the other hand, we say, why wouldn’t there be evil and suffering. That is the way things are.

It gets worse. Because the world is chaotic, we should not always expect simple cause-and-effect relationships between our actions and the consequences. Such inferences are only possible in simplified worlds. In the real one, we may be punished for doing what is by all accounts the right thing or rewarded for the wrong one. 

> In the complex world, the notion of “cause” itself is suspect; it is either nearly impossible to detect or not really defined—another reason to ignore newspapers, with their constant supply of causes for things. -- Nassim Taleb

These twin troubles were acknowledged by the ancient Greeks. The Stoics understood that ill fate could strike them at any moment. In the aptly titled _The Fragility of Goodness_, Martha Nussbaum discusses the role that good luck plays in being a good person in the Greek tragedies. For the Greek tragedians, to be a good person is to open ourselves up to the possibility that we might be punished for it. We cannot pretend that such disasters never happen. No system can withstand arbitrarily high degrees of chaos, which are bound to come marching at one time or another. 

In taking up this position, we also have to give up on high-resolution long-term planning. The future is unclear not only because we’re in a society whose foundations are ever-shifting but also because of black swans, to further borrow from Taleb’s vocabulary. We can safely assume tomorrow will look like today, but it’s less wise to assume ten years from now will look like today. Slow, gradual changes and fast, violent ones are liable to significantly change the landscape. Which implies that our plans should be most precise in the near term and slowly drop off as we go further ahead in time.

There are a plethora of further implications to ponder, but this will do for now.
