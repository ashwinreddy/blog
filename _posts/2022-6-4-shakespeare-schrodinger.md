In the comic above, the mathematician is pure because her work can be completed and verified by the mind alone. Next comes the physicist because theoretical principles drive his models, which agree with the data extraordinarily well. Purity here means logical consistency, being strict and clear about what counts as kosher. 

But the division between fields is a self-imposed illusion.

> If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts—physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on—remember that nature does not know it! — Richard Feynman

Fields develop tools for specific problems because specific problems are difficult and require expertise. Problem is, the disciplines become microcosms.

Reinforcement learning is a field in artificial intelligence that teaches agents by giving them numerical rewards. It's starting to come into real systems like self-driving cars. Yet philosophers have gripes with utilitarianism, an ethic which similarly maximizes agent utility. Surreptitiously, self-driving cars have entered the philosophical debate. If we find that a technical approach to morality doesn't pan out, what can we do but shake our heads? There were people working on this problem already, but they didn’t talk to each other. 

That’s not the only issue. Take a step back, as Feynman did. Because nature doesn’t care about field distinctions, we want the fields to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. It should be clear how they all fit together. Take another step back. Science and mathematics don’t emerge from nowhere. They are human enterprises and only became widespread under certain historical conditions. Those conditions undoubtedly inform how mathematics is done and what problems they work on. If sociology is impure, then math and physics have been infected, too.

The results in physics and mathematics are the most solid, but our collective interests don’t end at physics and math. The distinction between fields is not only irrelevant for nature, it is also irrelevant for our theoretical and practical interests. Wherever we might increase understanding, we should seek it, regardless of its field. That was the aim of the Enlightenment, which gave us the project of reason. _Sapere aude!_

It so happened that physics and math flourished earlier and to a greater extent. They made the easy gains first because reductionism (great lecture by Robert Sapolsky about [it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf8jwEGRo)) helped us spot the patterns. Take an example from math. When you understand linear algebra well, you can understand anything that can be modeled as linear. The results look elegant because you focused on an elegant structure, but the tool breaks down as things become more non-linear.

Back to understanding. What we want is bigger picture, something like what the Germans call _Wissenschaft_, systematic knowledge that encompasses both the sciences and arts. I'm fascinated by Deleuze's picture of philosophy, art, and science. 

* Philosophy invents concepts and uses logical deduction. Hence, its abstract nature and the emphasis on arguments. Philosophy rarely gives us the “right” answer. It gives us the conceptual tools and vocabulary for exploring the space of possible answers. It proliferates facts from and about concepts.
* Art uses percepts / affects and uses inductive reasoning. A film or novel tries to capture the world and proposes some generalization or pattern out of it. Because it is inductive reasoning, we can argue about whether we agree with the resulting principle or not. Because it is inductive and relies on a form of thinking that considers emotions, it is sometimes seen as flimsy thinking. But, unlike the other two, it has the possibility of telling us what we _ought_ to want or have.
* Science develops functives (algorithms, equations, etc.) and uses abductive reasoning. It attempts to create explanations from data. When technology uses science as a jumping-off point, it uses the explanation as a tool; however, technology does not always come from scientific understanding first.

Again, a reminder that these are human enterprises. My skepticism about how knowledge progresses is due to paradigms.[^kuhn] People are usually either solving puzzles in an existing paradigm created by somebody before them, or scrambling around to figure out a new paradigm that can make sense of it. It's not guaranteed to uncover truth. That doesn't invalidate the work, but it does make the idea of a "pure" field silly.

[^kuhn]: I’m lifting this from my woefully limited understanding of Thomas Kuhn’s _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_.

For that reason, I believe in **consilience**, that when multiple sources or methods agree, we are more assured of the validity. Biology and physics work because they cohere despite looking at different data and using distinct approaches. Hence it’s useful to apply one field’s thinking to another. It can help us better systematize the knowledge. In [I should have loved biology](https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology/), James Somers laments the limp facts presented in biology class (which amounts to neither art, philosophy, nor science) but notes ways of making sense of biology systematically. In his book _What is Life_, Schrodinger applies his physicist’s insight to biology to determine that something like DNA must exist in cells, which would be confirmed 9 years later. Other books along this line I enjoy are Richard Hamming’s _The Art of Doing Science and Engineering_ or Douglas Hofstadter’s _Godel, Escher, Bach_. But read some Shakespeare, too. It’s fun, and it gives you another way of seeing the world.

I didn't learn this in school, focusing on assignments and exams. When I rest and digest, I see Kant had the right questions: What can I know? What must I do? What may I hope? No teacher can answer for us. That's _mauvaise foi_.
