title: "What Classics Mean to Me"
---

What is considered classical depends on context. For Anglophones, it invokes the ancient Greeks and Romans. In literature, a classic is a particularly influential text. In science and engineering, a classical technique or model is one that is well-understood and discussed in classrooms, but not where the cutting edge operates. I can't speak to classical music, but it too belongs to this set.

A classic is timeless, enduring and leaving a wake. Its maturity is revealed by age, esteem, effect, and complexity. 

_Example_. Newton's _Principia_, a work published 335 years ago, is still the foundation for physicists. But even modern quantum mechanics relies on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, which are mathematical reformulations of Newton's work. Going back to fundamentals can be fruitful.

_Example_. The Greeks and Romans, for better or for worse, greatly affected the development of the Western world, many times over. To get a good grasp on the most impactful works of literature and philosophy, it helps to start at the beginning. If you need a starter, try [this](https://www.readthegreatbooks.com/). At some point, though, you should outgrow it and have your own canon. 

Read the classics. You won't have Truth, but you will know where we came from and how far we've come. I like Italo Calvino's _Why Read the Classics?_, a love letter to classical literature. Calvino's work is fresh, exciting, and original. Yet he pays his tributes too. 

For all that, we cannot, should not, read only the classics. There is always new work left for us, says Derek Walcott in [Sea Grapes](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57111/sea-grapes): "The classics can console. But not enough."
