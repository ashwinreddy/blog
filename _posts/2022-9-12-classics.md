For Anglophones, "classics" invokes the ancient Greeks and Romans. In literature, a classic is a particularly influential text. In science and engineering, a classical technique or model is one that is powerful but simple enough to be taught to freshmen. 

A classic is timeless, enduring and leaving a wake. Its maturity is revealed by age, esteem, effect, and complexity.

Read the classics. Or read Italo Calvino's _Why Read the Classics?_ Not for Truth but to know where we came from and how far we've come. And then go further. Derek Walcott writes in [Sea Grapes](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57111/sea-grapes): "The classics can console. But not enough."
