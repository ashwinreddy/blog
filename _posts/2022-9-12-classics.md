title: "What Classics Mean to Me"
---

What is considered classic(al) depends on context. For Anglophones, it invokes the ancient Greeks and Romans. In literature, a classic is a particularly influential text. In science and engineering, a classical technique or model is one that is well-understood and discussed in classrooms, but not where the cutting edge operates. I can't speak to classical music, but it too belongs to this set.

A classic is timeless, enduring and leaving a wake. Its maturity is revelead by age, esteem, effect, and complexity. 

_Example_. Newton's _Principia_, a work published 335 years ago, is still the foundation for physicists. But even modern quantum mechanics relies on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, which are mathematical reformulations of Newton's work. Going back to fundamentals can be fruitful.

Studying the classics is worthwhile, even if it would require serious preparation, but it is not terribly important to have a list, which experts call a syllabus. If you need a starter for classics in literature and philosophy, try [this](https://www.readthegreatbooks.com/). At some point, you should outgrow it. 

Read only the classics. You won't have Truth, but you will know from whence we came and how far we've come. I like Italo Calvino's _Why Read the Classics?_, a love letter to classical literature. Calvino's work is fresh, exciting, and original. Yet he pays his tributes too. 

For all that, we cannot, should not, read only the classics. Aged wine is powerful, and not to be drank every night. There is always more work left to do when we wake up in the morning, says Derek Walcott in [Sea Grapes](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57111/sea-grapes): "The classics can console. But not enough."
