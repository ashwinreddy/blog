title: "What Classics Mean to Me"
---

What is considered classic or classical depends, of course, on context. In history, it refers to cultures of antiquity, particularly those of ancient Greece and Rome for Anglophones. In literature, a classic is a particularly influential text. In the sciences and engineering, a classical technique or model is often one which is well-understood and discussed in classrooms, but, of course, it's not where the cutting edge operates. I can't speak to classical music, but it too belongs to this set.

Between all these wildly different examples, there is an underlying commonality, which is either fourfold or one. It is either a function of age, esteem, effect, and complexity; or, if you like, simply the aspect of maturity. A classic field or work has been around for a while, enough time to gain praise, yet still remaining relevant to us now. Classics are touchstones and mile-markers. They inaugurate a field or mark a significant change in one. 

Take physics, a field which has made incredible advancements in the last hundred years. We now have much better models of physics than Newton's _Principia_. And yet, every year, thousands or millions of people will learn physics as classical mechnanics. In fact, quantum mechanics relies on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, which are mathematical reformulations of Newton's work. Going back to fundamentals can be fruitful.

By definition, studying classics is worth your time, even if it would require serious prep to understand. But as you read classics in a field, you will find that it opens itself up to you more and more. When we look at the classics, we have one eye on the past, standing in well-trodden territory we see what has already been understood. And in that pose, we begin to see how different and how similar things are now. 

It is not terribly important to enumerate the classics of a field except to guide the beginner and reflect the expert's best survey of the field, what we call a syllabus. There may be disagreements between lists, but where there is consensus, there is something worth excavating. 

If you read only the classics, you may not have the complete truth, but you will know, or at least have some sense of, where we came and how far we've come. I would point you to Italo Calvino's _Why Read the Classics?_, a love letter to classical literature. Calvino's work is fresh, exciting, and original. Yet he pays his tributes too. This is well. 

All that is left for me to say is that we do not, should not, read only the classics. Aged wine is powerful, and not for every night. There is always more work left to do, says Derek Walcott in [Sea Grapes](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57111/sea-grapes): "The classics can console. But not enough."
