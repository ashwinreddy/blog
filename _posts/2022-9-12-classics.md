title: "What Classics Mean to Me"
---

What is considered classic or classical depends, of course, on context. In history, it refers to cultures of antiquity, particularly those of ancient Greece and Rome for Anglophones. In literature, a classic is a particularly influential text. In the sciences and engineering, a classical technique or model is often one which is well-understood and discussed in classrooms, but, of course, it's not where the cutting edge operates. I can't speak to classical music, but it too belongs to this set.

There is a unity to these fields which is either fourfold or one. It is either a function of age, esteem, effect, and complexity; or, if you like, simply the aspect of maturity. A classic has been around long enough to leave an indelible impact, in a way that is still relevant to us now. A touch stone or mile-marker, it either inaugurates a field or marks a significant change in one.

Take physics, a field which has made incredible advancements in the last hundred years. We now have much better models of physics than Newton's _Principia_. And yet, every year, thousands or millions of people will learn the physics first formulated in _Principia_. Further, modern quantum mechanics relies on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, which are mathematical reformulations of Newton's work. Going back to fundamentals can be fruitful.

By definition, studying classics is worthwhile, even if it would require serious preparation. It is not terribly important to have a list of all the classics of a field, except that experts sometimes want to tell students what's worth reading. This is called a syllabus.

If you read only the classics, you may not have the complete truth, but you will know, or at least have some sense of, where we came and how far we've come. I would point you to Italo Calvino's _Why Read the Classics?_, a love letter to classical literature. Calvino's work is fresh, exciting, and original. Yet he pays his tributes too. 

But we cannot, should not, read only the classics. Aged wine is powerful, and not to be drank every night. There is always more work left to do when we wake up in the morning, says Derek Walcott in [Sea Grapes](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57111/sea-grapes): "The classics can console. But not enough."
