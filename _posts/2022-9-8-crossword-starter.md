title: "NYT Crossword Resources"

If you're getting into the New York Times Crossword, here are resources to keep handy. If you're just getting into them, I recommend starting with the Mini Crossword, then moving to the Monday full-sized Crosswords.

The Times has written its own guide [here](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/crosswords/how-to-solve-a-crossword-puzzle), which will give you the basics of how crosswords operate. I found this guide invaluable, but the big thing is to practice, practice, practice.

On a given day, I like to attempt the puzzle without any external resources. If I'm getting stuck, I allow myself to consult Wikipedia or Google for simple facts. If that doesn't work, I resort to [Crossword Solver](https://www.wordplays.com/crossword-solver/). After completion, I read [Rex Parker](https://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/)'s notes on the solve. 

Last but not least, don't forget to brush up on your crosswordese!
