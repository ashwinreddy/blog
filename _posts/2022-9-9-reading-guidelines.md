title: "My Reading Philosophy"
---

In the last few years, I've done a lot of reading. Naturally, I have thoughts, based on my personal experience and taste, for cultivating a more fruitful experience. 

The main principle is to not read books that are not worth reading. If I feel a book is wasting my time, I stop. I start 10x more books than I finish. This approach is called [reading a lot with a strong filter](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/how-to-read-lots-of-inputs-and-a-strong-filter/). If you read a lot with a strong filter, you'll know what your taste is because you've sampled a wide variety of books, but you won't have wasted time in the process.

Consequently, I have a long reading list and a large [antilibrary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilibrary). I take book recommendations, note down titles during Wikipedia rabbit holes, and regularly look at websites with curated choices. For example, at [Five Books](https://fivebooks.com/), each article is an interview with an expert recommending 5 books on a topic. I also like [The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/). Or I just look at related books, either by topic or author or genre.

Reading widely demands different techniques of reading, suitable for different cases. In particular, skimming helps me decide what a book is about or quickly find a specific fact in an information-dense book. For physical books, I frequently use the index, table of contents, etc. 

Finally, I try to reflect on these questions, drawn from Mortimer Adler, after completing a book.

1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail, and how?
3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
4. What of it?
