I just read my friend Sarv's [post](https://sarvasvkulpati.com/blog/believe) of this same name and felt like I needed one of my own as well.

I believe the big question is what it means to be a (human) being. And I think the answer is to create and experiment with what life could be. Sometimes the creations are monstrous, sometimes glorious. The only way to know is to try, with good judgement.

Creation and experimentation require both theory and practice in the right proportion.


- Only a fraction of ideas are good and worthwhile ([Pareto](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-22-the-8020-rule)), what matters is the intuition to know which and the willingness to see those through.
- A rationality that won't acknowledge what it does not know or understand is rigid, inflexible, ultimately doomed.
- Do not claim to know what you do not know. Have a high bar for evidence before accepting something.

## What do I think is important?

- The value and celebration of [[Play]] and [fun](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZJBighPrnv9bSqTZ/31-laws-of-fun).
- Calibrated uncertainty, i.e. calculated risk.
