title: "A New Myth"
---

Writing a creation myth for the modern age would be a fun experiment. Such a work belongs to the genre of mythopoesis, perhaps accomplished best by Tolkien in _The Silmarillion_. About half a century before that book, T.S. Eliot wrote the modernist masterpiece _The Waste Land_, inspired by scholarly works on mythology. But his is a desolate and gloomy image. Instead, I find myself drawn to the creation myth told by Ovid in _Metamorphoses_ Book 1 not only because I am fascinated by how Chaos operates but also because I enjoy imagining how the world came to be, the same reason I like reading Genesis 1. While it is important that we know we are spiritually lost, we also need something that helps us control disorder. That is the aim of the new creation myth.

There is a school of philosophical and scientific thought that sees Chaos and Information as fundamental to reality. I belive they are and should be the cornerstone of this myth. The difficulty will be in blending the technical aspects with a compelling story. We will see where it goes.

A question to answer: what exactly does this Chaos look like? Is it more or less the same one as Ovid? It definitely is not Milton's Chaos. How does Deleuze's Chaos compare with Ovid's? What about Joyce's chaosmos?

A style: not written in archaic language or scientific jargon or in Latinate. Simple, refined English.

A starting point: Chaos decomposes into Entropy and Mutability. Seen from an angle, we have Cosmos split into Predictability and Stability. Together, we have Chaosmos.

An idea worth exploring: flood myths. Both Ovid and Moses give us flood myths. The modern flood is not one of water, however, but of information. How can we make that idea clear?

A theme to include: that humans are special because they play games and solve problems (these are one and the same). We are technical creatures, we repond to Chaos. But we're not _that_ special. Might be interesting to think about [names for the human species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_the_human_species).
